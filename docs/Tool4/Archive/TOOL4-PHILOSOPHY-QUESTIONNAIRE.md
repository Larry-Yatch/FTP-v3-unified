# Tool 4: Base Weights Optimization - Philosophy Questionnaire

**Date:** November 17, 2025
**Purpose:** Capture your clinical and financial philosophy to guide all weight optimization decisions
**Instructions:** Answer each question with as much detail as you're comfortable with. Your answers will establish the principles that guide every weighting decision.

## 🎯 **SECTION 1: Core Philosophy - The Four Buckets**

### **Q1. Multiply Bucket (Investments & Long-Term Wealth)**

**What's the absolute minimum percentage someone should invest even in crisis/survival mode?**

- [ ] 0% is acceptable in true crisis (survival first, wealth later)
- [ ] 5% minimum (legacy "Stabilize to Survive" setting)
- [ ] 10% minimum (break poverty cycle, always build for future)
- [ ] 15% minimum (industry standard, no exceptions)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Rationale/Philosophy:**
```
[Your answer here - why this minimum?]




```

**Follow-up:** At what point does aggressive investing (40%+ Multiply) become harmful rather than helpful?
```
[Your answer here]




```

### **Q2. Essentials Bucket (Housing, Food, Utilities, Transport, Insurance)**

**What's a realistic Essentials percentage range for your student population?**

Check all that apply:
- [ ] Low income ($2K-$3K/month): ____ to ____ %
- [ ] Medium income ($4K-$6K/month): ____ to ____ %
- [ ] High income ($8K+/month): ____ to ____ %

**Should Essentials % decrease as income increases?**
- [ ] Yes, high earners should be more efficient (e.g., $3K essentials on $10K income = 30%)
- [ ] No, lifestyle naturally scales with income (e.g., $5K essentials on $10K income = 50%)
- [ ] Depends on student's values/goals

**Rationale/Philosophy:**
```
[Your answer here - how do you clinically define "essentials" vs "lifestyle creep"?]




```

**Specific Question:** The legacy "Enjoy Life Now" priority has 20% Essentials. Is $1,000/month realistic for housing + food + utilities + transport for someone making $5K/month?
- [ ] Yes, possible with roommates/efficiency
- [ ] No, unrealistic—should be 30-35% minimum
- [ ] Depends on geography (HCOL vs LCOL)

```
[Your reasoning]


```

---

### **Q3. Freedom Bucket (Debt Payoff, Emergency Fund, Medium-Term Savings)**

**What's the minimum emergency fund you'd recommend before investing aggressively?**
- [ ] $500-$1,000 (micro-emergency fund)
- [ ] 1 month expenses
- [ ] 3 months expenses
- [ ] 6 months expenses
- [ ] Varies by income stability

**For someone focused on debt payoff, what's the maximum % of income that should go to Freedom (debt payments) before it becomes deprivation/burnout risk?**
- [ ] 40% maximum
- [ ] 50% maximum (aggressive but sustainable)
- [ ] 60%+ acceptable if highly motivated
- [ ] No maximum—let them choose

**Rationale/Philosophy:**
```
[Your answer here]




```

---

### **Q4. Enjoyment Bucket (Entertainment, Hobbies, Dining Out, Experiences)**

**What role does enjoyment spending play in financial health and trauma recovery?**
```
[Your clinical perspective - when does enjoyment serve healing vs avoidance?]






```

**What's the maximum Enjoyment % that's healthy/sustainable?**
- [ ] 20% (align with 50/30/20 rule's "wants")
- [ ] 30% (balanced)
- [ ] 35% (high but acceptable for life-balance priority)
- [ ] 45% (legacy "Enjoy Life Now" setting—is this enabling or honoring?)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Follow-up:** Should we even have a priority with 45% Enjoyment, or is that setting students up for failure?
- [ ] Keep 45%—some students need permission to enjoy life
- [ ] Lower to 35% maximum—45% is unsustainable
- [ ] Remove "Enjoy Life Now" priority entirely—it enables poor decisions

**Rationale:**
```
[Your answer here]




```

## 🧠 **SECTION 2: Trauma-Informed Principles**

### **Q5. Fear/Control Trauma Patterns**

**When a student has Fear or Control as their Tool 1 winner AND high dissatisfaction (8+/10), what allocation approach is most healing?**

- [ ] **Stability first:** High E+F (40-50%), Low M (10-15%)—they need safety before growth
- [ ] **Motivated growth:** Apply satisfaction amplifier—high dissatisfaction = ready for change
- [ ] **It depends:** Fear = stability, other trauma patterns = growth

**Current legacy system:** Applies satisfaction amplifier universally (1.3x boost to all positive modifiers). Should we make this trauma-informed?

- [ ] Yes—Fear/Control winners should NOT get amplifier (overwhelm ≠ motivation)
- [ ] Yes—but only dampen it (1.15x instead of 1.3x)
- [ ] No—keep universal amplifier, trust the student's dissatisfaction signal

**Rationale/Philosophy:**
```
[Clinical perspective on trauma + dissatisfaction interaction]




```

---

### **Q6. Deprivation vs. Balance**

**What's the minimum Enjoyment % to prevent deprivation-binge cycles?**
- [ ] 5% minimum
- [ ] 10% minimum (legacy "Stabilize to Survive" and others)
- [ ] 15% minimum
- [ ] No minimum—some students need extreme discipline

**Should high-trauma students (Fear, Control, FSV winners) have HIGHER Enjoyment allocations for healing, or LOWER to build stability first?**
- [ ] Higher—trauma recovery requires self-care and pleasure
- [ ] Lower—stability before enjoyment
- [ ] Depends on trauma type and recovery stage

**Rationale:**
```
[Your answer here]




```

## 📊 **SECTION 3: Priority Set Validation**

### **Q7. Duplicate/Similar Priorities**

**Issue: "Save for a Big Goal" and "Get Out of Debt" have IDENTICAL weights (M:15, E:25, F:45, J:15)**

These should serve different purposes:
- "Get Out of Debt" = Paying OFF past (eliminate debt)
- "Save for Big Goal" = Saving FOR future (house, car, wedding)

**Should we differentiate them?**
- [ ] Yes—"Save for Big Goal" should have HIGHER Multiply (savings can grow in investments)
  - Proposed: M:25, E:25, F:40, J:10
- [ ] Yes—but different approach: _______________
- [ ] No—keep identical, they're both "allocating toward a specific goal"

**Your decision:**
```
[Your reasoning]



```

---

### **Q8. Overlapping Priorities**

**"Feel Financially Secure" (M:25, E:35, F:30, J:10) vs "Reclaim Financial Control" (M:10, E:35, F:40, J:15)**

These are very similar (both high E+F for stability). Should we:

- [ ] **Keep both separate**—"Reclaim Control" is specifically for trauma recovery
- [ ] **Merge into one**—call it "Build Financial Security" (covers both)
- [ ] **Differentiate more clearly**—adjust weights to make them distinct
  - How? _______________

**If keeping separate, what's the clinical distinction?**
```
[When would you recommend "Feel Secure" vs "Reclaim Control"?]




```

---

### **Q9. Life Balance vs Enjoy Life**

**"Enjoy Life Now" (M:20, E:20, F:15, J:45) vs "Create Life Balance" (M:15, E:25, F:25, J:35)**

Both have high Enjoyment focus. Should we:

- [ ] **Keep both**—they serve different purposes
  - "Enjoy Life Now" = _______________
  - "Create Life Balance" = _______________
- [ ] **Merge into one**—redundant high-enjoyment priorities
- [ ] **Remove "Enjoy Life Now"**—45% Enjoyment is too high, keep only "Life Balance" at 35%

**Your decision:**
```
[Your reasoning]




```

---

### **Q10. Should We Add New Priorities?**

**Are there any common student goals/situations NOT covered by the current 10 priorities?**

Potential additions:
- [ ] "Retire Early" (FIRE focus: M:50+%, E:20%, F:20%, J:10%)
- [ ] "Support Family/Dependents" (E:40%, F:30%, M:15%, J:15%)
- [ ] "Career Transition" (F:40%, E:30%, M:15%, J:15%)
- [ ] "Break Trauma Patterns" (Healing-focused, moderate all buckets)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Or should we keep it to 10 priorities maximum?**
- [ ] Keep at 10—too many choices = decision paralysis
- [ ] Expand to 12-15—cover more use cases
- [ ] Let me add: _______________

## 🔍 **SECTION 6: Specific Priority Challenges**

### **Q15. "Stabilize to Survive" - The 5% Multiply Question**

**Current:** M:5, E:45, F:40, J:10

**Scenario:** Student makes $3,000/month
- Multiply: $150/month = $1,800/year investing
- Essentials: $1,350/month
- Freedom: $1,200/month
- Enjoyment: $300/month

**Philosophy question:** Can someone truly "stabilize" long-term with only 5% going to wealth building?

- [ ] Yes—survival first, wealth later. Once stable, move to "Feel Secure" priority.
- [ ] No—5% perpetuates poverty cycle. Raise to 10-15% minimum.
- [ ] It depends—5% is ok SHORT-term (<6 months), then encourage priority change.

**What's the intended duration for "Stabilize to Survive" priority?**
- [ ] 3-6 months (crisis mode, then transition)
- [ ] 6-12 months (recovery period)
- [ ] 12+ months acceptable
- [ ] As long as needed—no time limit

**Your decision:**
```
M:_____ E:_____ F:_____ J:_____

Rationale:




```

### **Q16. "Enjoy Life Now" - The 20% Essentials Question**

**Current:** M:20, E:20, F:15, J:45

**Scenario:** Student makes $5,000/month
- Multiply: $1,000/month
- Essentials: $1,000/month (rent + food + utilities + transport = impossible in most cities)
- Freedom: $750/month
- Enjoyment: $2,250/month

**Is this allocation realistic, or does it set unrealistic expectations?**

- [ ] Realistic with efficiency (roommates, low-cost area, frugal habits)
- [ ] Unrealistic—raise Essentials to at least 30-35%
- [ ] This priority shouldn't exist—it enables poor financial decisions
- [ ] Keep but rename/reframe to clarify intent

**If keeping this priority, what's the clinical purpose?**
```
[When would you recommend "Enjoy Life Now" to a student?]





```

**Your decision:**
```
Keep as-is / Modify to M:___ E:___ F:___ J:___ / Remove entirely

Rationale:




```

### **Q17. "Create Generational Wealth" - Who Selects This?**

**Current:** M:45, E:25, F:20, J:10

**Who is the target student for this priority?**
- [ ] High earner ($10K+/month) already established
- [ ] Anyone aspiring to build legacy (any income level)
- [ ] Business owners building equity
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Should this priority have income requirements to unlock?**
- [ ] Yes—only show for students with $8K+/month income
- [ ] Yes—only show if Tool 2 shows financial stability
- [ ] No—anyone can aspire to generational wealth

**Should Essentials be lower for this priority?**
- [ ] Yes—lower to 20% (established wealth-builders have efficiency)
- [ ] No—keep at 25% (realistic baseline)

**Your decision:**
```
M:_____ E:_____ F:_____ J:_____

Target student:

## 📋 **SECTION 7: Implementation Preferences**

### **Q18. How Strict Should Base Weights Be?**

**After modifiers are applied (±50 points), allocations can shift significantly. Should we:**

- [ ] **Strict base weights**—ensure base always produces reasonable starting point, even with max modifiers
- [ ] **Flexible base weights**—let modifiers have large impact, base is just a suggestion
- [ ] **Trauma-informed flexibility**—different strictness for high-trauma vs low-trauma students

**Example:** "Build Long-Term Wealth" base M:40
- After +50 modifiers: Could become M:60+ (too aggressive?)
- After -20 modifiers: Could become M:20 (contradicts intent?)

**Should we cap the final percentages AFTER modifiers?**
- [ ] Yes—enforce minimums/maximums even after modifiers
- [ ] No—let modifiers override base weights completely
- [ ] Soft limits—warn student if allocation seems extreme, but allow

---

### **Q19. Student Guidance**

**When a student selects a priority, should we:**

- [ ] Show example allocation BEFORE they enter any data (preview)
- [ ] Wait until they enter data, then show personalized allocation
- [ ] Both—show base example, then update with their data

**Should we auto-recommend priorities based on Tool 1/2/3 results?**
- [ ] Yes—"Based on your Fear trauma pattern, we recommend 'Feel Financially Secure' or 'Reclaim Financial Control'"
- [ ] Yes—but only as suggestions, not forcing
- [ ] No—let student choose freely

---

### **Q20. Validation & Testing**

**After we optimize the weights, how should we validate they're correct?**

- [ ] Test with real student data (if available)
- [ ] Test with hypothetical scenarios (I create 20+ test cases)
- [ ] Get external review (financial advisor, CFP)
- [ ] User testing (show to small group of students)
- [ ] All of the above

**What does "success" look like for an optimized priority?**
```
[How will we know the weights are correct?]
