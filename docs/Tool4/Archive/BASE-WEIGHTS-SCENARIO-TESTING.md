# Tool 4: Base Weights Scenario Testing

**Date:** November 18, 2025
**Purpose:** Validate M/E/F/J base weights with 20 realistic student scenarios
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress

---

## Testing Methodology

For each scenario:
1. Define student financial situation
2. Apply base weights from their selected priority
3. Calculate dollar amounts (not just percentages)
4. Evaluate: "Does this feel right for this student?"
5. Identify any unrealistic allocations

**Target Coverage:**
- Low income: $2K-$3.5K/month (6 scenarios)
- Medium income: $4K-$7K/month (8 scenarios)
- High income: $8K-$15K+/month (6 scenarios)
- Various debt levels (none, moderate, high)
- Various emergency funds (none, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo+)
- All 10 priorities tested

## TIER 1: CRISIS/ENTRY LEVEL PRIORITIES

### **Scenario 1: Recent Grad in Crisis**
**Priority:** Stabilize to Survive (M:5%, E:50%, F:35%, J:10%)

**Student Profile:**
- Income: $2,800/month
- Actual Essentials: $2,300/month (82%)
- Emergency Fund: $300
- Debt: $35K student loans (low interest)
- Surplus: $500/month

**Recommended Allocation (Base Weights):**
- M: 5% × $2,800 = **$140/month**
- E: 50% × $2,800 = **$1,400/month** ⚠️
- F: 35% × $2,800 = **$980/month**
- J: 10% × $2,800 = **$280/month**

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ **PROBLEM**: E allocation of $1,400 is $900 LESS than actual spending ($2,300)
- ⚠️ **Gap**: Student would need to cut $900/month from essentials immediately
- ⚠️ Reality check: Rent alone is likely $1,000-$1,200 in most markets
- ✅ F allocation ($980) is good for building emergency fund + minimum debt payments
- ❓ **Question**: Is 50% E too low for "Stabilize to Survive"? Should be 60-65%?

**Analysis:**
- ⚠️ **PROBLEM**: E allocation of $1,120 is $1,280 LESS than actual spending ($2,400)

## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

### 🔴 **Critical Issues Identified:**

#### **Issue 1: Low-Income + High-E Priorities = Unrealistic Gaps**

**Problem Scenarios:**
- Scenario 1: "Stabilize to Survive" (50% E) with $2,800 income
- Scenario 2: "Reclaim Control" (35% E) with $3,200 income
- Scenario 11: "Stabilize to Survive" (50% E) - Single parent with $3,200 income

**Pattern:**
- When income < $4,000/month AND base E% < 40%, allocations are unrealistic
- Students in crisis mode often have legitimately high essentials due to:
  - Limited housing options (can't afford roommates if single parent)
  - Geographic constraints (already in MCOL/HCOL areas)
  - Essential childcare costs
  - Limited ability to negotiate rent/utilities

**Recommendation:**
- ⚠️ **ADJUST**: Increase E% for low-income crisis priorities:
  - "Stabilize to Survive": 50% → **60-65%**
  - "Reclaim Financial Control": 35% → **40-45%**
  - "Get Out of Debt": 30% → **35%** (for income < $4K)

---

#### **Issue 2: "Get Out of Debt" E% (30%) Too Aggressive**

**Problem Scenarios:**
- Scenario 3: Entry-level with $3,500 income (gap of $950)
- Scenario 12: High debt, low income with $3,000 income (gap of $900)

**Pattern:**
- 30% E consistently creates $800-$1,000 gaps for incomes < $5,000
- Students already in debt often have limited optimization opportunities
- Risk: Setting unrealistic expectations → failure → giving up

**Recommendation:**
- ⚠️ **ADJUST**: Increase "Get Out of Debt" E from 30% → **35%**
- Rationale: Makes debt payoff sustainable, not punishing

### ✅ **Priorities That Work Well:**

#### **Well-Calibrated Priorities:**
1. **Create Life Balance** (M:15%, E:25%, F:25%, J:35%) - ✅ Works great
2. **Save for a Big Goal** (M:25%, E:25%, F:40%, J:10%) - ✅ Excellent
3. **Build Long-Term Wealth** (M:40%, E:25%, F:20%, J:15%) - ✅ Works well
4. **Enjoy Life Now** (M:20%, E:20%, F:15%, J:45%) - ✅ Works (with strict unlock)
5. **Create Generational Wealth** (M:50%, E:20%, F:20%, J:10%) - ✅ Works for high earners
6. **Build/Stabilize Business** (M:20%, E:30%, F:35%, J:15%) - ✅ Appropriate

**Common Success Factor:**
- These priorities typically unlock at higher income levels ($5K+)
- At higher incomes, E% between 20-30% is more achievable
- Students have more room for essential optimization

## RECOMMENDED BASE WEIGHT ADJUSTMENTS

### **PRIORITY 1: Stabilize to Survive**
**Current:** M:5%, E:50%, F:35%, J:10%
**Proposed:** M:5%, **E:60%**, **F:30%**, J:5%

**Rationale:**
- Students in crisis mode (income < $4K) need higher E percentage
- Reduced J from 10% → 5% to prevent deprivation crisis
- Reduced F from 35% → 30% to balance essentials need
- This better reflects reality of living paycheck-to-paycheck

---

### **PRIORITY 2: Reclaim Financial Control**
**Current:** M:10%, E:35%, F:40%, J:15%
**Proposed:** M:10%, **E:45%**, **F:35%**, J:10%

**Rationale:**
- Trauma recovery requires sustainable essentials, not aggressive cuts
- Increased E from 35% → 45% for realistic trauma-informed approach
- Reduced F from 40% → 35% to balance
- Reduced J from 15% → 10% to prioritize control

### **PRIORITY 3: Get Out of Debt**
**Current:** M:15%, E:30%, F:40%, J:15%
