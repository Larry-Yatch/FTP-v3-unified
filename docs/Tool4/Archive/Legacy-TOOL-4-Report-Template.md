**Introduction**

This report is designed to reflect both your current financial reality and your deeper behavioral patterns. It combines your inputs with a behavioral allocation model to create a plan that’s tailored to your needs, not just your numbers. The goal is to help you build trust in your financial system, support better decisions, and create clarity going forward.

This system is based on the Financial Truth Framework, which combines behavioral psychology and cash flow structure to help you create a financial system that reflects your values, rather than your fears or trauma.

## **Your Final Allocation**

This section shows your personalized percentages across the four core financial buckets. These allocations are based on your unique goals, behavioral tendencies, and financial context. Use them to guide how you split incoming funds—whether manually or through separate accounts—to support healthy, values-based decisions.

**Financial Freedom Bucket** (Debt, Emergency Fund, Medium-Term Goals): {{Freedom\_Percent}}%
