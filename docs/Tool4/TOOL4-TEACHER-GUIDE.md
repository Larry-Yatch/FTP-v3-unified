# Tool 4: Financial Freedom Framework — Teacher Guide

**Purpose:** Help students discover their optimal budget allocation across four buckets: Multiply, Essentials, Freedom, and Enjoyment (M/E/F/J).

---

## What This Tool Does

Tool 4 guides students through a personalized budget allocation process. Unlike generic budgeting advice, it adapts to each student's financial reality, behavioral tendencies, and stated priorities.

**The student journey:**
1. Complete a 10-question pre-survey (2-3 minutes)
2. Select a financial priority and timeline
3. Receive a personalized allocation recommendation
4. Adjust using interactive sliders
5. Validate their plan with built-in safety checks
6. Save and compare multiple scenarios
7. Download a personalized PDF report

## The Four Buckets Explained

| Bucket | Purpose | Typical Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Multiply** | Long-term wealth building (investments, retirement) | 5-50% |
| **Essentials** | Fixed living expenses (rent, food, utilities, insurance) | 20-60% |
| **Freedom** | Financial security (debt payoff, emergency fund, savings goals) | 10-45% |
| **Enjoyment** | Present quality of life (dining, hobbies, entertainment) | 5-45% |

---

## Pre-Survey Questions

**Financial Reality (4 questions):**
- Monthly take-home income
- Monthly essential expenses
- Total debt (excluding mortgage)
- Emergency fund amount

**Behavioral Profile (6 sliders, 0-10):**
- Financial satisfaction (stress level)
- Financial discipline
- Impulse control
- Long-term focus
- Lifestyle priority (save vs. enjoy)
- Autonomy preference (guidance vs. independence)

| Priority | Focus | Key Bucket |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Stabilize to Survive | Crisis mode | Essentials + Freedom |
| Reclaim Financial Control | Trauma recovery | Freedom |
| Get Out of Debt | Aggressive debt payoff | Freedom (40%+) |

## How the Calculator Works

### Personalized Recommendation
The algorithm generates an initial allocation based on:
- Selected priority + timeline
- Behavioral scores (discipline, impulse control, etc.)
- Financial reality (income, debt, emergency fund status)

### Interactive Adjustment
Students can:
- **Move sliders** — Other buckets adjust proportionally to maintain 100%
- **Lock buckets** — Protect specific allocations from changes
- **Reset** — Return to the recommended allocation

### Validation ("Check My Plan")
When clicked, the system checks for:

**Critical Issues (must address):**
- Essentials allocation less than actual essential spending

**Warnings (should consider):**
- High debt with low Freedom allocation
- High income with lifestyle inflation patterns

**Suggestions (worth reviewing):**
- Large deviation from recommended allocation
- Priority/allocation mismatch

Each issue includes an expandable "helper" with:
- Specific calculations using their numbers
- Clear explanation of the concern
- One-click action buttons to adjust

## Scenario Comparison

Students can save up to 10 named scenarios (e.g., "Aggressive Debt Payoff" vs. "Balanced Approach") and compare them side-by-side:

- Allocation percentages and dollar amounts
- Strategy detection (what each approach emphasizes)
- Impact narratives (lifestyle implications of each choice)

---

## PDF Reports

**Main Report includes:**
- Executive summary with GPT-generated personalized insights
- Full allocation breakdown with dollar amounts
- "Why these numbers?" explanation
- Validation results and recommendations
- Next steps based on their priority

**Comparison Report includes:**
- Side-by-side allocation table
- Dollar and percentage differences
- Impact analysis per bucket
- Decision guidance for choosing between scenarios

## Teaching Opportunities

### Discussion Prompts
- "Why did you choose this priority? What would change if you chose differently?"
- "The validation flagged a warning. What tradeoff are you making?"
- "Compare your two scenarios. What are you giving up in each?"
- "Your allocation differs from the recommendation. What's your reasoning?"

### Common Student Patterns to Watch For
- **Over-optimistic Enjoyment** — Allocating more fun money than their discipline score suggests they can maintain
- **Ignoring debt** — Choosing wealth-building priorities while carrying high-interest debt
- **Fear-based hoarding** — Over-allocating to Freedom when emergency fund is already adequate
- **Priority mismatch** — Stating "Build Wealth" but allocating heavily to Enjoyment

### Intervention Points
- If a student dismisses all warnings without reading helpers
- If scenarios are nearly identical (not exploring tradeoffs)
- If allocation is extreme (any bucket at 0% or 60%+)

## Data You Can Review

- **Pre-survey responses** — Financial reality and behavioral profile
- **Saved scenarios** — All allocations the student explored
- **PDF reports** — Final chosen allocation with reasoning
- **Validation interactions** — Which helpers they engaged with

---

## Key Pedagogical Goals

1. **Self-awareness** — Students see how their behaviors influence financial outcomes
2. **Tradeoff thinking** — Every allocation choice has consequences
3. **Agency with guardrails** — Students control their plan, but get warned about risks
4. **Experimentation** — Multiple scenarios encourage exploration before commitment
5. **Grounded decisions** — Abstract priorities become concrete dollar amounts
