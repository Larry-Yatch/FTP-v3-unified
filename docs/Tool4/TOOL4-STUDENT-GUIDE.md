# Tool 4: Financial Freedom Framework — Student Guide

**What is this?** A personalized budget calculator that helps you divide your income into four buckets based on your financial goals and situation.

---

## The Four Buckets

Your entire take-home income gets divided into these four categories:

| Bucket | What It Covers | Think of it as... |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Multiply** | Investments, retirement savings, wealth building | Future You money |
| **Essentials** | Rent, food, utilities, insurance, transportation | Bills and basics |
| **Freedom** | Debt payoff, emergency fund, savings goals | Security money |
| **Enjoyment** | Dining out, hobbies, entertainment, travel | Fun money |

Together, these always equal 100% of your income.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Answer 10 Questions (2-3 minutes)

You will answer questions about:
- Your monthly income and expenses
- Your debt and emergency savings
- How you feel about money (stress, discipline, impulse control)

There are no wrong answers. Be honest — the tool adapts to your real situation.

### Step 2: Choose Your Priority

Select the financial goal that matters most to you right now:

- **Stabilize to Survive** — Get through a financial crisis
- **Reclaim Financial Control** — Rebuild after financial stress or trauma
- **Get Out of Debt** — Pay off what you owe as fast as possible
- **Feel Financially Secure** — Build a safety net
- **Create Life Balance** — Find harmony between saving and living
- **Build/Stabilize Business** — Support your entrepreneurial goals
- **Save for a Big Goal** — House, car, wedding, or major purchase
- **Build Long-Term Wealth** — Grow your investments aggressively
- **Enjoy Life Now** — Prioritize experiences and quality of life today
- **Create Generational Wealth** — Build a legacy for your family

You will also select a timeline (6 months to 5+ years).

### Step 3: See Your Personalized Allocation

Based on your answers, you will see a recommended split like:

```
Multiply:    25% ($875/month)
Essentials:  35% ($1,225/month)
Freedom:     25% ($875/month)
Enjoyment:   15% ($525/month)
```

This is your starting point — not a final answer.

### Step 4: Adjust With Sliders

You can change any bucket using the sliders. When you move one:
- Other buckets adjust automatically to keep the total at 100%
- You can **lock** any bucket to protect it from changing

Play around. See what different splits feel like.

### Step 5: Check Your Plan

Click **"Check My Plan"** to validate your allocation. The tool will flag:

- **Critical issues** (red) — Things that will not work mathematically
- **Warnings** (yellow) — Patterns that often cause problems
- **Suggestions** (blue) — Ideas worth considering

Each flag has a **"Learn More"** button with specific details using your actual numbers.

### Step 6: Save and Compare Scenarios

Save different versions of your allocation:
- "Aggressive Debt Payoff"
- "More Fun Money"
- "Balanced Approach"

Then compare them side-by-side to see the tradeoffs.

### Step 7: Download Your Report

- Your final allocation and dollar amounts

## Tips for Using This Tool

### Be Honest in the Pre-Survey
The tool cannot help you if you overstate your discipline or understate your debt. Your answers stay private.

### Your First Allocation is a Starting Point
The recommended split is based on patterns that work for people in similar situations. But you know your life better than any algorithm.

### Pay Attention to Warnings
If the tool flags something, read the helper before dismissing it. The warnings exist because these patterns often cause problems.

### Try Multiple Scenarios
Do not settle on your first attempt. Save it, then try something different. Comparing two or three options helps you understand what you are really choosing.

### Dollar Amounts Make It Real
Percentages can feel abstract. Look at the actual monthly dollar amounts. Can you really live on that Essentials number? Is that Enjoyment amount enough for you?

## Common Questions

**What if I do not know my exact numbers?**
Estimates are fine. Use your best guess for income, expenses, debt, and savings.

**Can I change my priority later?**
Yes. Your priority is not permanent. As your situation changes, come back and select a new one.

**What if I disagree with the recommendation?**
That is okay. The sliders let you customize everything. Just pay attention to any warnings that appear.

**Why is my Enjoyment so low?**
If you have debt or a small emergency fund, the tool prioritizes Freedom first. This is not permanent — once you build security, more flows to Enjoyment.

**What does "lock" do?**
Locking a bucket means it will not change when you adjust other sliders. Use this to protect a number you have decided on.

## The Goal

This tool is not about finding the "right" answer. It is about:

1. **Understanding your situation** — Seeing your finances clearly
2. **Aligning money with values** — Spending in ways that match what matters to you
3. **Seeing tradeoffs** — Every dollar in one bucket is a dollar not in another
4. **Making intentional choices** — Deciding on purpose, not by accident

Your allocation will change as your life changes. Use this tool whenever you need to reassess.
