# Financial Trauma Patterns: Co-Occurring Matrix

## Purpose
This document maps which financial trauma patterns commonly co-occur and why. Understanding pattern combinations enables more accurate diagnosis and targeted intervention design. The theoretical framework is based on shared roots, complementary mechanisms, and logical reinforcement patterns.

## Part 1: Quick Reference Matrix

### Co-Occurrence Likelihood Grid

|  | **FSV** | **ExVal** | **Show Love** | **Receive Love** | **Control** | **Fear** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **False Self-View** | â€” | Medium | Medium | Low | **HIGH** | **HIGH** |
| **External Validation** | Medium | â€” | **HIGH** | Low | Medium | Low |
| **Showing Love** | Medium | **HIGH** | â€” | Rare | **HIGH** | Medium |
| **Receiving Love** | Low | Low | Rare | â€” | Rare | Medium |
| **Control** | **HIGH** | Medium | **HIGH** | Rare | â€” | **HIGH** |
| **Fear** | **HIGH** | Low | Medium | Medium | **HIGH** | â€” |

### Key:
- **HIGH** = Very common combination; patterns strongly reinforce each other
- **Medium** = Moderately common; patterns can coexist without direct reinforcement
- **Low** = Uncommon; patterns have different mechanisms but don't contradict
- **Rare** = Very uncommon; patterns tend to be contradictory or mutually exclusive

### Pattern Abbreviations:
- **FSV** = False Self-View
- **ExVal** = External Validation
- **Show Love** = Issues Showing Love
- **Receive Love** = Issues Receiving Love

## Part 2: Common Combination Profiles

### HIGH LIKELIHOOD COMBINATIONS

---

#### **Combination 1: False Self-View + Control**
**"I'm inadequate AND only I can keep me safe"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both patterns stem from fundamental distrustâ€”of self and of the universe. FSV creates the confusion and lack of clarity and scarcity that "proves" inadequacy. Control attempts to manage the chaos created by FSV through rigid management, but the control strategies (not charging, not collecting, giving away) actually create more scarcity, which reinforces the inadequacy belief.

**How They Interact:**
- FSV creates scattered, inaccessible money
- Control responds by trying to manage everything tightly
- But Control manifests as going without and not charging
- This creates actual scarcity that FSV pointed to
- Each pattern provides evidence for the other

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person has money in multiple hidden places they can't access (FSV), charges far below market rate and doesn't collect invoices (Control), lives in manufactured scarcity that "proves" both their inadequacy and their need to control. Chronic anxiety, exhaustion, and shame dominate. Often presents as "I'm just not good with money AND I can't trust anyone else to help."

**Behavioral Markers:**
- Scattered accounts with unclear totals (FSV)
- Artificially low pricing (Control)
- Uncollected receivables (Control)
- Never having money when needed despite working constantly (both)
- Refuses to delegate or hire help (Control)
- Analysis paralysis mixed with hypervigilance (both)

---

#### **Combination 2: False Self-View + Fear**
**"I'm inadequate AND the world is hostile"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both rooted in deep unworthiness and expectation of negative outcomes. FSV creates confusion and lack of clarity to avoid facing potential, Fear ensures disasters to avoid visibility. Both keep the person small and "safe" from having to step into their capabilities. The inadequacy belief makes the world feel more threatening; the hostile world "proves" the inadequacy.

**How They Interact:**
- FSV keeps money inaccessible (staying small through confusion and lack of clarity)
- Fear ensures wrong choices and no protection (staying small through disaster)
- FSV confusion and lack of clarity makes person vulnerable to Fear's bad trust decisions
- Each disaster (Fear) reinforces "I'm not good with money" (FSV)
- Both prevent accumulation of resources or capability

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person has money scattered and inaccessible (FSV), repeatedly trusts wrong people and gets burned (Fear), stops projects just before completion (Fear), lives in chronic financial crisis. Presents with resignation: "Bad things just happen to me, I'm not good with money anyway." Deep shame mixed with dread.

**Behavioral Markers:**
- Money exists but can't access it (FSV)
- Repeated pattern of trusting people they knew better than to trust (Fear)
- No contracts or protection in deals (Fear)
- Financial close calls and manufactured crises (FSV)
- Self-sabotage at threshold of success (Fear)
- Confusion and lack of clarity about where money is combined with disasters (both)

---

#### **Combination 3: External Validation + Showing Love**
**"Others determine my worth AND suffering proves love"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both are strategies to gain acceptance and prove worthiness through external means. ExVal uses financial appearance to gain acceptance. Showing Love uses financial sacrifice to prove care. Together they create a person who must both LOOK successful (or appropriate) AND sacrifice/give to others. Both prevent authentic connectionâ€”one through performance, one through martyrdom.

**How They Interact:**
- ExVal requires spending on image maintenance
- Showing Love depletes resources through sacrifice
- Both create financial strain and eventual scarcity
- The scarcity threatens the image (ExVal), requiring more performance
- More sacrifice is needed to "make up for" not being good enough (both)
- Exhaustion and resentment build from maintaining both strategies

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person buys status symbols and maintains expensive lifestyle (ExVal) while also bailing out family/friends and refusing repayment (Showing Love). Chronically depleted financially and emotionally. Presents as "people-pleaser" who needs everyone to think well of them AND needs to prove they care through sacrifice. High guilt, exhaustion, resentment, and fear of exposure.

**Behavioral Markers:**
- Status spending for appearance (ExVal)
- Financial gifts and bailouts to others (Showing Love)
- Refusing repayment (Showing Love)
- Lying about financial situation to maintain image (ExVal)
- Debt from both image maintenance and helping others (both)
- Overwork to fund both performance and sacrifice (both)
- No authentic relationships (both prevent vulnerability)

---

#### **Combination 4: Showing Love + Control**
**"Suffering proves love AND only I can keep me safe"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both are active strategies rooted in distrust of natural flow. Showing Love believes others won't be okay without their sacrifice. Control believes nothing will be okay without their management. Together they create someone who must both DO for others (Showing Love) and control everything themselves (Control). Both prevent trustâ€”in others' capability and in the universe's support.

**How They Interact:**
- Showing Love gives away resources
- Control ensures underearning (not charging, not collecting)
- Both create scarcity and exhaustion
- Scarcity "proves" they need to do both more
- Can't delegate (Control) so must do everything
- Must sacrifice for others (Showing Love) so always depleted
- The depletion proves they need control

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person doesn't charge appropriately (Control), has uncollected invoices (Control), gives money/services away to family (Showing Love), refuses repayment (Showing Love), won't hire help or delegate (Control), exhausted from doing everything. Presents as martyr who must control everything because "if I don't do it, it won't get done AND others need me." Chronic anxiety, resentment, exhaustion, guilt.

**Behavioral Markers:**
- Not charging what they're worth (Control)
- Giving services/money away to loved ones (Showing Love)
- Uncollected invoices piling up (Control)
- Taking on others' obligations (Showing Love)
- Won't delegate or hire help (Control)
- Refusing repayment (Showing Love)
- Living in scarcity despite working constantly (both)

---

#### **Combination 5: Control + Fear**
**"Only I can keep me safe AND the world is hostile"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both patterns exist within the same domainâ€”Disconnection from All That's Greater. They represent active vs. passive responses to the same core belief: "I am alone in a threatening universe with no support beyond myself." Control tries to manage the threat through rigid oversight. Fear withdraws and ensures disasters happen. Often the same person uses both strategies in different contexts.

**How They Interact:**
- Control creates scarcity through not charging/collecting (active management)
- Fear ensures disasters through bad trust/no protection (passive sabotage)
- Control's scarcity makes person vulnerable to Fear's disasters
- Fear's disasters "prove" the need for more Control
- Both prevent trust in anything greater
- Both isolate the person from support

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person undercharges and doesn't collect invoices (Control), but also trusts wrong people and skips contracts (Fear). Living in manufactured scarcity (Control) with repeated disasters (Fear). Presents as hypervigilant and paranoid, yet makes obviously poor trust decisions. Chronic anxiety, dread, exhaustion. Often says "I can only count on myself" while simultaneously creating situations where they get burned.

**Behavioral Markers:**
- Not charging worth, uncollected invoices (Control)
- Trusting people they knew not to trust (Fear)
- No contracts or protection in deals (Fear)
- Hoarding money while going without (Control)
- Self-sabotage just before success (Fear)
- Refusing to invest or use money (Control)
- Repeated disasters that could have been prevented (Fear)
- Artificial scarcity despite resources (Control)

### MEDIUM LIKELIHOOD COMBINATIONS

---

#### **Combination 6: False Self-View + External Validation**
**"I'm inadequate AND others determine my worth"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both exist within Disconnection from Self domain. Both involve distorted self-perception, but through different mechanisms. FSV creates internal confusion and lack of clarity about capability; ExVal externalizes worth to others' judgments. Can coexist when person both believes they're inadequate AND needs external validation to determine if that's true.

**How They Interact:**
- FSV creates confusion and lack of clarity and scarcity
- ExVal requires spending to manage image
- The scarcity (FSV) threatens the performance (ExVal)
- The need for validation (ExVal) prevents addressing confusion and lack of clarity (FSV)
- Both prevent authentic self-knowledge

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person has scattered finances they can't access (FSV) but also spends on status symbols (ExVal). Confused about actual financial state while managing image for others. May present as "I don't know where I stand financially, but I need people to think I'm doing well."

---

#### **Combination 7: False Self-View + Showing Love**
**"I'm inadequate AND suffering proves love"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Different domains but both rooted in unworthiness. FSV believes "I'm not good enough" and Showing Love believes "I must prove my worth through sacrifice." Together they create someone who feels inadequate and tries to compensate through giving.

**How They Interact:**
- FSV creates scarcity through confusion and lack of clarity
- Showing Love depletes through sacrifice
- Both create financial crisis
- Sacrifice "proves" value despite inadequacy
- Neither strategy addresses the unworthiness

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person can't access their own money (FSV) but gives away what they can to others (Showing Love). Living in confusion and lack of clarity and scarcity while sacrificing for others. Deep shame and guilt, exhausted and resentful.

---

#### **Combination 8: External Validation + Control**
**"Others determine my worth AND only I can keep me safe"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
ExVal requires managing others' perceptions; Control requires managing financial details. Both are about managing and preventing negative outcomes. Can coexist when person needs to control their image AND control their finances.

**How They Interact:**
- ExVal requires spending on image
- Control limits earning (not charging, not collecting)
- Both create scarcity
- Image becomes harder to maintain (ExVal)
- More control needed to manage the scarcity (Control)

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person charges low prices (Control) but buys status items (ExVal), won't delegate (Control) but maintains expensive image (ExVal). Contradiction between control-driven scarcity and image-driven spending creates financial stress.

---

#### **Combination 9: Showing Love + Fear**
**"Suffering proves love AND the world is hostile"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Different domains and mechanisms (active giving vs. passive hiding), but can coexist in different relationship contexts. May give sacrificially to inner circle (Showing Love) while hiding from broader world (Fear).

**How They Interact:**
- Showing Love depletes resources
- Fear prevents accumulating resources (sabotage)
- Both create scarcity and vulnerability
- Different contexts trigger different patterns
- Both prevent thriving

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person sacrifices for close family (Showing Love) while sabotaging career opportunities (Fear). Gives away money to loved ones while ensuring professional disasters. Compartmentalized patterns in different life domains.

---

#### **Combination 10: Receiving Love + Fear**
**"I need others for financial safety AND the world is hostile"**

**Why They Co-Occur:**
Both are passive strategies about withdrawal and smallness. Receiving Love creates dependency on others; Fear keeps person hidden and small. Both prevent self-sufficiency and visibility.

**How They Interact:**
- Receiving Love creates financial dependency
- Fear prevents stepping into capability or visibility
- Dependency keeps person "safe" from having to be visible
- Fear justifies needing others to take care of things
- Both prevent growth and thriving

**Clinical Presentation:**
Person relies on partner/family financially (Receiving Love) and sabotages opportunities for independence (Fear). Dependency feels "safer" than visibility. Trapped and resentful but afraid to change.

---

### LOW LIKELIHOOD COMBINATIONS

These combinations can technically coexist but are less common because the mechanisms don't directly reinforce each other:

#### **Combination 11: False Self-View + Receiving Love**
Different mechanisms (confusion and lack of clarity vs. dependency), different domains. Can coexist but don't particularly reinforce each other. Person might be both confused about finances AND dependent on others, but these are somewhat independent dysfunctions.

#### **Combination 12: External Validation + Receiving Love**
Contradictory in practice. ExVal requires managing image and appearing capable; Receiving Love involves being openly dependent. Hard to maintain both simultaneously, though possible in different contexts (e.g., appearing successful publicly while being dependent privately).

#### **Combination 13: External Validation + Fear**
Contradictory mechanisms. ExVal requires visibility and performance; Fear requires hiding and invisibility. These strategies work against each other. Rare to see both as primary patterns.

---

### RARE/CONTRADICTORY COMBINATIONS

These combinations are very unlikely because the strategies directly contradict each other:

#### **Combination 14: Showing Love + Receiving Love**
**Cannot be primary patterns simultaneously in same relationships.** Showing Love is active giving/sacrificing; Receiving Love is passive receiving/depending. Can occur in DIFFERENT relationships (e.g., sacrificing for children while depending on partner) but not as co-primary patterns in same dynamic.

#### **Combination 15: Receiving Love + Control**
**Nearly opposite strategies.** Receiving Love involves letting others manage finances and make decisions; Control involves managing everything oneself. These are contradictory core mechanisms. Extremely rare to see both as primary patterns.

## Part 3: Assessment Implications

### Identifying Primary vs. Secondary Patterns

**Primary Pattern:**
- Strongest behavioral signature present
- Most distress/dysfunction generated
- Most deeply rooted in person's history
- Appears across multiple life domains

**Secondary Pattern:**
- Present but less dominant
- May be context-specific
- Often develops as response to primary pattern
- Less historical depth

### Common Primary-Secondary Relationships

**FSV Primary â†’ Control Secondary:**
Person starts with inadequacy/confusion and lack of clarity (FSV), develops controlling behaviors as coping mechanism to manage the chaos they've created.

**ExVal Primary â†’ Showing Love Secondary:**
Person needs acceptance (ExVal), learns that sacrifice is a way to earn it, develops Showing Love pattern.

**Control Primary â†’ Fear Secondary:**
Person tries to control everything (Control), but when control fails, Fear pattern emerges in specific contexts.

### Assessment Questions

When multiple patterns appear present:

1. **Which came first chronologically?**
   - Often indicates primary pattern

2. **Which creates more dysfunction?**
   - Usually the primary pattern

3. **Which appears more automatic/unconscious?**
   - Primary patterns are more deeply ingrained

4. **Are they domain-specific?**
   - Same pattern across domains = primary
   - Different patterns in different contexts = both may be strong

5. **Do they reinforce each other?**
   - HIGH likelihood combinations often both strong
   - LOW/RARE combinations usually one primary, one secondary

## Part 4: Clinical Notes

### Pattern Clustering by Domain

**Disconnection from Self (FSV + ExVal):**
- Less likely to have both as co-primary
- More likely one is primary, other secondary
- Often appear sequential rather than simultaneous

**Disconnection from Others (Showing Love + Receiving Love):**
- Almost never co-primary in same relationships
- May appear in different relationships (give to kids, receive from partner)
- Context-dependent manifestation

**Disconnection from Greater (Control + Fear):**
- Very commonly co-occur as both primary
- Active vs. passive responses to same root belief
- Often alternate based on context or trigger

### Intervention Implications

**High Likelihood Combinations:**
Must address both patterns for effective intervention. Addressing only one may cause person to lean harder on the other.

**Medium Likelihood Combinations:**
Can often address primary pattern successfully; secondary may resolve naturally or need separate attention.

**Low/Rare Combinations:**
If both appear present, likely one is primary and driving the other. Address primary first; secondary often resolves.

### Pattern Transitions

Patterns can shift over time:
- **FSV â†’ Control:** As FSV creates chaos, Control develops to manage it
- **ExVal â†’ Showing Love:** As performance fails, sacrifice becomes new strategy
- **Control â†’ Fear:** As control exhausts, Fear takes over (passive withdrawal)
- **Showing Love â†’ Receiving Love:** As resources deplete from sacrifice, must become dependent

Understanding these transitions helps predict pattern evolution and intervene earlier.

## End Notes

This matrix is based on theoretical logic derived from pattern mechanisms, shared roots, and reinforcement dynamics. As clinical data accumulates, these likelihood ratings should be updated to reflect actual presentation frequencies. The framework provides a starting point for understanding how patterns interact, which enables more sophisticated assessment and targeted intervention design.

---

## Quick Reference: Most Common Combinations

For rapid clinical reference, the most likely co-occurring patterns are:

1. **False Self-View + Control** (inadequacy + control chaos)
2. **False Self-View + Fear** (inadequacy + ensure disasters)
3. **External Validation + Showing Love** (perform + sacrifice)
4. **Showing Love + Control** (sacrifice + manage everything)
5. **Control + Fear** (same domain, active + passive)

These five combinations account for the majority of co-occurring pattern presentations and should be the first to assess when multiple patterns appear present.
