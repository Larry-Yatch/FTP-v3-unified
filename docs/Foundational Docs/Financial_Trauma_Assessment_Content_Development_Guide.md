# Financial Trauma Patterns: Tool Development Guide

**Purpose:** This document defines six distinct financial trauma patterns for assessment tool development. Each pattern is defined across four measurable components: Core View/Untruth, Observable Behaviors, Emotional States, and Measurable Consequences.

**Usage:** Use this document to design exercises and assessment items that help students identify which unconscious strategies are driving their financial behaviors and outcomes.

## Framework Overview

**Three Core Domains of Disconnection:**
1. Disconnection from Self (rooted in low self-worth)
2. Disconnection from Others (rooted in conditional love)
3. Disconnection from All That's Greater (rooted in attachment to made-up future)

**Active vs. Passive Strategies:**
- Each domain contains two strategies: one active (doing/creating), one passive (allowing/withdrawing)
- **Active patterns:** The person does, creates, or takes action to maintain the strategy
- **Passive patterns:** The person allows, withdraws, or lets things happen to maintain the strategy

## DOMAIN 1: DISCONNECTION FROM SELF

### 1A. FALSE SELF-VIEW (Active)
**"Money is Safety" - I will gain safety through money**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "I am fundamentally inadequate and only through accumulating enough money can I become safe and worthy"
- Fixed identity: "I'm not good with money," "I'll never have enough," "I'm not capable"
- Safety is purchased through money rather than cultivated through self-trust
- Who I am right now is insufficient; money will make me adequate

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Selective financial blindness:** When feeling scarce, pays attention to spending but ignores income sources; when feeling abundant, pays attention to income but ignores spending patterns
- Never has money accessible when needed despite earning adequately
- Money scattered across multiple accounts, hidden locations, or forgotten about
- Creates recurring financial "close calls" (always just barely making it)
- Ignores or avoids looking at actual financial situation (unopened statements, avoiding account logins)
- Uses incoherent financial strategies that cannot possibly achieve stated goals
- Perpetual learning/researching without implementing (analysis paralysis)

**Emotional States:**
- Shame about being "broken" or fundamentally flawed with money
- Chronic sense of inadequacy around financial capability
- Confusion and fogginess about actual financial reality
- Low-grade persistent anxiety about not having enough (even when resources exist)
- Numbness or dissociation from financial reality as protection
- Guilt for not being "better" despite knowing what to do

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Never has money available when needed despite adequate income
- Resources exist but are scattered/inaccessible for big purchases (house, car, investments)
- No functional emergency fund despite having money (it's just not accessible)
- Self-created financial crises from manufactured confusion
- Significant opportunity cost from paralysis and inaction
- Pattern perpetuates: each consequence "proves" inadequacy, reinforcing false self-view

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern where the person creates confusion and lack of clarity about their actual financial situation. Money exists but they can't see or access it clearly.

---

### 1B. EXTERNAL VALIDATION (Passive)
**"Money is Acceptance" - We gain acceptance through money**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "My worth is determined by others' judgment of my financial situation"
- Must curate perception of financial status to be accepted and loved
- Acceptance is conditional upon how my finances appear to others
- The "real me" (actual financial situation) isn't enough for acceptance

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Misrepresenting financial situation:** Appearing to have MORE (status symbols, lifestyle inflation, keeping up appearances) OR appearing to have LESS (hiding wealth, downplaying success to avoid judgment/envy)
- All purchases filtered through "What will they think?" rather than actual need or desire
- Spending to maintain membership in certain social circles regardless of actual affordability
- Lying about income, assets, debt, or spending to maintain chosen image
- Concealing both financial struggles AND financial wins
- Accumulating debt specifically to project success or acceptance
- Career/job choices made for prestige/appearance rather than fit

**Emotional States:**
- Fear of being "found out" or exposed; constant dread of discovery
- Hypervigilance about others' perceptions and potential judgment
- Deep shame about the gap between image and reality
- Insecurity that shifts based on perceived approval or disapproval
- Exhaustion from maintaining the performance continuously
- Profound loneliness (they love the performance, not the real you)
- Imposter syndrome and feeling like a fraud

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Destructive debt accumulated from maintaining image
- Depleted or nonexistent savings (money spent on performance)
- No emergency fund (can't save while funding appearances)
- Chronic overwork to fund required lifestyle/image
- Financial crisis when facade becomes unsustainable and collapses
- Zero genuine financial help available (pride prevents asking; no one knows the truth)
- Scarcity despite adequate income (always broke from image spending)
- Career misalignment (wrong jobs chosen for external validation)

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern focused on managing others' perception. Everything is about how it LOOKS to others, not actual financial reality or strategy.

---

## DOMAIN 2: DISCONNECTION FROM OTHERS

### 2A. ISSUES SHOWING LOVE (Active)
**"Money is Sacrifice" - Love is proven through financial sacrifice**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "If I don't sacrifice financiallyâ€”even at my own expenseâ€”I don't truly care"
- Suffering and financial sacrifice are the measures and proof of love
- Self-depletion equals caring; boundaries equal selfishness
- "If I have enough money, it will free us from sacrifice" (but connecting sacrifice to love ensures perpetual sacrifice)

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Taking on others' financial obligations even when not asked:** Paying for capable adults, bailing out repeatedly, covering others' responsibilities
- Going without necessities personally so others can have what they want
- Giving/lending money from scarcity (can't afford it but does anyway)
- Buying guilt-driven gifts beyond means to demonstrate care
- **Refusing repayment when offered** ("I don't want it back" because receiving would lessen suffering)
- Providing professional services to friends/family without fair exchange
- Being permanent financial safety net; always available for rescue
- Enabling others' dysfunction by preventing natural financial consequences

**Emotional States:**
- Pervasive guilt that they're not doing enough; should sacrifice more
- Growing resentment toward those being helped (often hidden even from self)
- Physical and emotional exhaustion from depletion
- Anxiety about own financial situation while continuing to give
- Martyrdom mixed with righteousness ("at least I care")
- Feeling unappreciated or taken for granted
- Helplessness and feeling trapped (can't say no without being "bad")

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Depleted emergency funds and savings (no buffer for self)
- Personal debt accumulated from helping others beyond means
- Cannot meet own financial goals (retirement, house, education always delayed)
- Financial instability; always on edge with no margin
- Money "lent" to friends/family never repaid (and won't be pursued)
- Retirement shortfall from years of sacrificing savings
- Others become dependent on the sacrifice; pattern escalates
- Enabling perpetuates problems (help prevents growth/change)
- Inevitable personal financial crisis when reserves completely depleted

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern where the person REFUSES repayment. The suffering itself is the proof of love; receiving would diminish that proof.

---

### 2B. ISSUES RECEIVING LOVE (Passive)
**"Money is Evil" - Money is fundamentally corrupt and corrupting**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "Money is fundamentally evil and corrupting"
- "If I have money, I become evil; staying financially dependent/poor keeps me morally good"
- "By allowing financial dependency on others, I avoid the evil of having money"
- This creates obligation: "You gave to me, I owe you" (preventing experience of unconditional love)

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Becoming/remaining financially dependent on others** despite capability (relying on partner, family, friends for financial support)
- Repeatedly borrowing from friends/family, creating ongoing obligation
- Letting someone else manage money, make all financial decisions, or control accounts
- Accepting support that comes with expectations or conditions (strings attached)
- Not building own financial literacy; remaining "helpless" about money management
- Allowing others to pay for things repeatedly, building "debt of gratitude"
- Not pursuing income or wealth-building (money is evil, so unconsciously avoid having it)

**Emotional States:**
- Heavy sense of obligation and owing others ("I'm indebted to them")
- Guilt about needing support and not repaying adequately
- Powerlessness from dependency; feeling unable to make own choices
- Shame about inability to be financially independent
- Anxiety about the strings attached and potential loss of support
- Resentment toward those depended upon (even while needing them)
- Fear that support will be withdrawn; belief that can't survive alone
- Disconnection from love (obligation contaminates all care received)

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Chronic financial dependence; no self-sufficiency developed
- Debt owed to individuals (friends/family), damaging relationships
- No financial literacy skills; ignorance about basic money management
- Vulnerability to financial abuse or exploitation through dependency
- Loss of financial agency; others make decisions about money and life
- Poverty perpetuation (viewing money as evil prevents wealth-building)
- Generational pattern (children learn dependency is normal)
- Relationship destruction from accumulated obligation and resentment
- Financial crisis if support ends (no skills or resources to survive alone)

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern where the person creates DEPENDENCY and resulting obligation. Money is seen as morally corrupting, so they avoid having it but become dependent on others' money.

## DOMAIN 3: DISCONNECTION FROM ALL THAT'S GREATER

### 3A. CONTROL LEADING TO ISOLATION (Active)
**"Money is Control" - We will gain control through money**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "Safety comes from controlling every financial detail"
- "If I maintain rigid control, I'll prevent chaos and loss"
- Cannot trust anything or anyone else with financial matters
- "Even if I have money, since the money is not me, I can never have control"
- Control into suffering: going without proves I need control to survive

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Not charging what you're worth:** Keeping fees artificially low to maintain control of client base
- **Accounts receivable piling up:** Not collecting owed money; letting invoices go unpaid for extended periods
- **Giving things away for free:** Providing services or products without charge
- Hoarding money in accounts while simultaneously living in lack (refusing to use resources)
- Refusing to invest or use appropriate investment vehicles (keeping everything in low-yield savings)
- Obsessively tracking every penny while going without necessities
- Creating overly complex financial systems that actually create chaos
- Living far below means despite having resources available

**Emotional States:**
- Pervasive anxiety and worry about potential loss or chaos
- Fear that everything could fall apart at any moment
- Overwhelming sense of needing to manage everything alone
- Fundamental distrust of others, systems, and life itself
- Bone-deep exhaustion from carrying everything alone
- Frustration at inability to control outcomes despite massive effort
- Resentment at others who seem to trust and flow
- Defensive superiority ("at least I'm responsible")

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Significant underearning from artificially low pricing (decades of lost income)
- Thousands to hundreds of thousands in uncollected accounts receivable
- Professional and business stagnation (won't hire, delegate, or scale)
- Lost income from free work that should have been paid
- Inability to enjoy or use money even when available
- Missed investment growth from decades of refusing to invest appropriately
- Living in artificial scarcity despite having money in accounts
- Control systems create chaos rather than order
- Retirement crisis from failure to invest appropriately over lifetime

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern of deliberate GOING WITHOUT and self-imposed suffering. Has money but won't use it, won't charge appropriately, won't collect what's owed.

---

### 3B. FEAR LEADING TO ISOLATION (Passive)
**"Money is Fear" - Through money we will free ourselves from fear**

**Core View/Untruth:**
- "The world is hostile to my thriving; visibility attracts danger"
- "I am safer staying small, hidden, and unnoticed"
- "I am alone in a threatening universe with no protection"
- "The more money I have, the more I fear its lossâ€”can't win either way"
- Unconsciously ensure things go wrong to prove world is unsafe

**Observable Behaviors:**
- **Trusting people you know better than to trust:** Ignoring red flags, working with people despite clear warnings
- **No contracts or legal protection:** Entering business deals without written agreements or proper documentation
- **Not protecting yourself:** Failing to take basic protective measures despite knowing better
- Creating financial problems just as things start going well (unconscious sabotage when thriving)
- Stopping projects just before completion or breakthrough
- Hiding money in unusual physical locations or forgotten accounts
- Not claiming benefits, programs, or opportunities you qualify for
- Refusing opportunities that could help out of fear they'll expose you

**Emotional States:**
- Existential fear and paranoid sense of threat from visibility or success
- Dread and anticipation that good things will be taken away or lead to disaster
- Constant anxiety that success will bring catastrophe
- Deep shame and unworthiness ("who am I to have/be/do this?")
- Hopelessness; belief that thriving isn't possible (resigned to struggle)
- Cynicism and protective distrust of good opportunities
- Grief over unlived life and unrealized potential
- Guilt about gifts/success ("who am I to shine when others suffer?")

**Measurable Consequences:**
- Self-created financial disasters from trusting wrong people (losses were predictable)
- Financial losses from lack of contracts/protection (no recourse when things go wrong)
- Chronic underearning (making fraction of potential income over decades)
- Business and project failures from poor trust decisions and lack of protection
- Repeated pattern of financial betrayal (burned by people you knew not to trust)
- Self-imposed poverty through fear-driven sabotage
- Missed opportunities from refusing chances out of fear
- No wealth accumulation due to sabotage pattern
- Retirement crisis from lifetime of underearning and disasters
- Each disaster "proves" world is unsafe, reinforcing fear

**Diagnostic Distinction:** The ONLY pattern where person ENSURES THINGS GO WRONG. Repeatedly trusts wrong people, enters unprotected deals, self-sabotages at thresholdâ€”creating the disasters feared.

## Tool Development Guidelines

### Assessment Design Principles:

1. **Unique Items:** Each assessment item should clearly belong to only ONE subdomain. If an item could fit multiple patterns, it's too general.

2. **Four-Component Scales:** Design scales that measure:
   - **View/Untruth Agreement** (1-5: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
   - **Behavior Frequency** (1-5: Never to Always/Very Often)
   - **Emotional Experience** (1-5: Never Experience to Always Experience)
   - **Consequence Presence** (1-5: Not True for Me to Very True for Me)

3. **Observable vs. Internal:** Behaviors and consequences should be as observable/measurable as possible; views and emotions are necessarily more subjective.

4. **Pattern Strength:** Higher scores across all four components indicate stronger presence of that pattern. Someone may score high on multiple patterns simultaneously.

5. **Diagnostic Clarity:** The distinctions documented here are absoluteâ€”use them to ensure no overlap in assessment items.

### Exercise Design Principles:

1. **Make It Visible:** Help students SEE where the strategy shows up by having them:
   - Track specific behaviors over a time period
   - Calculate actual consequences (dollars lost, opportunities missed)
   - Journal emotional patterns
   - Identify triggering situations

2. **Recognition Before Change:** Students must first recognize they HAVE the pattern before they can change it. Focus exercises on identification and awareness.

3. **No Shame:** These patterns are unconscious survival strategies. Frame exercises as discovery, not judgment.

4. **Specificity:** Use the unique behavioral signatures and consequences to create specific tracking/measurement exercises for each pattern.
