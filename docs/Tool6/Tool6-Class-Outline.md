## Transition: Where We Are in the Journey (5 minutes)

**The Four-Tool Arc:**

| Tool | Question It Answers | Outcome |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Clarity Tool** | "Where do I need to put attention?" | Understanding of your financial world |
| **Allocation Tool** | "What job does each dollar have?" | Every dollar assigned to M/E/F/J buckets |
| **Retirement Blueprint** | "How do I structure my Multiply bucket?" | A cascade plan for retirement accounts |
| **Investment Design** | "What do I invest in and how much?" | Scenarios for amount, strategy, and risk |

**Key framing:**
> "The Allocation Tool told you HOW MUCH goes to retirement. Today we're preparing you for the tool that tells you WHERE that money goes - which accounts, in what order, and why."

---

## Principle 1: The Retirement Account Menu (10 minutes)

**Core idea:** There's no single "best" account. The IRS created different vehicles for different people in different situations. This is why generic advice fails.

| Account | Best For | Not Great For | Works Well When Your Goal Is... |
|---------|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **401(k)** | W-2 employees with employer plans | Self-employed, no access | Steady, automatic wealth building with possible employer match |
| **IRA (Traditional/Roth)** | Everyone as a supplement; primary vehicle if no employer plan | High earners (Roth phases out) | Flexibility and control outside employer plan; Roth for tax-free retirement income |
| **HSA** | Anyone with a high-deductible health plan | Those without HDHP access | Triple tax advantage; building a healthcare "war chest" for retirement |
| **Solo 401(k)** | Self-employed with NO employees | Business owners with W-2 staff | Maximizing contributions as a solopreneur ($23k employee + 25% employer side) |
| **SEP-IRA** | Self-employed wanting simplicity; business owners with employees | Those wanting Roth option | Simple setup, high contribution limits (up to 25% of compensation) |
| **ROBS** | Business owners wanting to hyperfund retirement through their business | W-2 employees; those without $50k+ rollover funds | Aggressively catching up on retirement; turning business profits into retirement wealth |

### The "Free Money First" Rule

When covering 401(k), emphasize:

> "If your employer matches, this isn't just a good account - it's the best return you'll ever get. A 50% match means a 50% instant return. A 100% match means you double your money before it's even invested. That's why the tool always puts employer match at the top of your waterfall, regardless of your profile."

**Bridge to tool:** "The Retirement Blueprint looks at YOUR situation and filters this menu down to what's actually available and optimal for you."

---

## Principle 2: The Tax Timing Decision (10 minutes)

**Core idea:** You're not avoiding taxes - you're choosing WHEN to pay them.

### Traditional (Pre-tax)
- Pay taxes later, in retirement
- Good if you're in a higher tax bracket NOW than you expect to be in retirement
- Reduces your taxable income today

### Roth (After-tax)
- Pay taxes now, withdrawals are tax-free
- Good if you're in a lower tax bracket NOW than you expect to be in retirement
- Especially powerful for younger earners or those expecting income growth

### The HSA Exception
- Tax-deductible going in
- Grows tax-free
- Withdrawals tax-free for medical expenses
- The only "triple tax advantage" account - it's a cheat code

### How Your Tax Preference Changes the Tool's Recommendations

| Your Tax Preference | What the Tool Does | Why This Matters For You |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| **"Save taxes NOW"** (Traditional-heavy) | Prioritizes Traditional 401(k), Traditional IRA before Roth options | Your paycheck grows today - more money in your pocket right now when your tax rate is high |
| **"Save taxes LATER"** (Roth-heavy) | Prioritizes Roth 401(k), Roth IRA before Traditional options | Your retirement becomes tax-free - no surprises from the IRS when you start withdrawing |
| **"Balanced"** | Mixes both types based on your profile's default | You get flexibility - some tax relief now AND some tax-free money later |

**Bridge to tool:** "The tool asks about your tax preference, then reorders your account priority list accordingly. It's listening to YOUR situation."

---

## Principle 3: The Waterfall (10 minutes)

**Core idea:** Once you know your accounts, fill them in order - not equally.

- You don't split your retirement dollars evenly across accounts
- You fill the highest-priority account to its limit, THEN move to the next
- Each account has IRS limits - when one bucket is full, the overflow cascades to the next
- The order matters because of the different tax advantages

### Example Cascade for a W-2 Employee

1. 401(k) up to employer match → *filled*
2. HSA to max ($4,300 individual / $8,550 family) → *filled*
3. 401(k) Roth to max ($23,500) → *filled*
4. IRA Roth to max ($7,000) → *filled*
5. Remaining goes to taxable brokerage (Family Bank)

**Bridge to tool:** "The tool gives you YOUR specific waterfall order based on your profile. It knows all the IRS limits and handles the cascade automatically. Your job is to answer honestly about your situation - the tool handles the complexity."

---

## Principle 4: Your Profile Shapes Your Plan (8 minutes)

**Core idea:** The tool doesn't give generic advice. It classifies you into one of 9 investor profiles based on your situation, then tailors everything from there.

### The 9 Profiles

| Profile | Who It's For | Why This Matters For You |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **ROBS Strategist** | Already using ROBS structure | Your business IS your retirement vehicle - the tool optimizes around that reality |
| **ROBS Candidate** | Business owner who could benefit from ROBS hyperfunding | You have an opportunity most people don't - to accelerate retirement at 3-6x normal pace |
| **Business Owner (with employees)** | Self-employed with W-2 staff | You have access to powerful accounts (SEP, SIMPLE) but also obligations - the tool balances both |
| **Solo Operator** | Self-employed, no employees | You can access the Solo 401(k) - one of the highest contribution limits available ($69k+) |
| **Bracket Strategist** | Higher earner focused on reducing taxes NOW | Every dollar in Traditional accounts reduces this year's tax bill - timing matters for you |
| **Catch-Up Contributor** | Age 50+ accelerating savings | You have access to extra contribution room others don't - the tool maximizes that window |
| **Foundation Builder** | W-2 employee building steadily | Your path is straightforward - the tool gives you a clear, proven order to follow |
| **Roth Maximizer** | Lower bracket now, focused on tax-free retirement | Paying taxes now while your rate is low sets up tax-free income later |
| **Late-Stage Growth** | Within 5-10 years of retirement | Your timeline changes the strategy - preservation and catch-up become priorities |

### Why Profiles Matter

- Your profile determines which accounts are even relevant to you
- Your profile determines your waterfall order
- Your profile determines Traditional vs Roth emphasis

**Bridge to tool:** "When you open the tool, one of the first things you'll see is your profile. If it doesn't feel right, you can explore why it classified you that way - but most people find it captures their situation well."

---

## Principle 5: ROBS - The Hyperfunding Strategy (10 minutes)

**Core idea:** For business owners, your business can become a retirement acceleration engine.

### The Problem
- Standard account limits cap how fast you can save ($23k, $7k, etc.)
- If you're a business owner who's behind on retirement, these limits feel restrictive

### The ROBS Solution
- Rollover for Business Startups - but used in REVERSE
- Your 401(k) owns most of your C-corp
- Business profits flow back into retirement at levels far beyond normal limits

### Real Example

> "I run a C-corp that produces about $500,000 a year. Through the ROBS structure, my 401(k) owns 98% of the company. What does that mean practically? I contribute $100,000-$200,000 per year into retirement.
>
> Compare that to standard limits: a regular 401(k) maxes out at $23,500. Even with catch-up, you're at $31,000.
>
> ROBS lets you turn business success into retirement acceleration at 3-6x the normal pace."

### Not For Everyone
- Requires C-corp structure
- Need $50k+ in rollover-eligible retirement funds to start
- Business needs to be profitable
- More complex setup and compliance

**Bridge to tool:** "The tool identifies if you qualify for ROBS and what it could mean for your strategy. For business owners who feel behind, this is one of the most powerful options available."

## Principle 6: The Tool Listens to What Matters Most (8 minutes)

**Core idea:** The tool doesn't just look at your accounts - it weighs what matters most to YOU and how soon you need it.

### How the Ambition Quotient Works

| If You Tell the Tool... | The Tool Responds By... | Why This Matters For You |
|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Retirement is HIGH importance + deadline is CLOSE | Putting MORE of your budget toward retirement accounts | Your dollars go where your anxiety is highest - the tool prioritizes what keeps you up at night |
| Education is HIGH importance + kids starting college SOON | Putting MORE toward 529/Coverdell, even before some retirement | You avoid the panic of underfunded college - the tool respects your family priorities |
| Health is HIGH importance + you're HSA-eligible | Making sure HSA gets funded early in the waterfall | You build a medical safety net with the best tax treatment available |
| All three domains feel equally important | Asking a tie-breaker question, then boosting your choice by 10% | You break the tie - the tool doesn't guess, it asks |

### The Concept in One Sentence

> "The tool listens to what matters most to you AND how soon you need it, then tilts your budget toward what's most urgent and important."

**Bridge to tool:** "This is why the tool asks you to rate importance on a 1-7 scale. It's not busy work - those numbers directly shape how your budget gets divided."

---

## Closing: What Happens Next (5 minutes)

### The Trust Message

> "This tool does the hard work of knowing all the rules, limits, and edge cases so you don't have to. It's designed to cut through the complexity that keeps people frozen.
>
> Your job is to answer honestly about your situation. The tool's job is to give you a clear, prioritized plan."

### Timeline
- **Monday:** You'll get access to the Retirement Blueprint tool
- **Next Wednesday:** Q&A session to discuss your results

### Seeds for Next Week

As you use the tool, pay attention to:
- Which profile did it assign you? Does it feel right?
- Look at the waterfall order it recommends - what surprised you?
- Notice how your importance ratings affected the split between Retirement/Education/Health
- Come ready to ask "why did it recommend X for me?"
