## Transition: Where We Are in the Journey (5 min)

1. **Connect to what they just finished:** "You've done the hard internal work in Tools 1-5. You understand your patterns, your identity around money, and how you connect financially with others. Now we shift to structure."

2. **The handoff from Tool 4:** "The Allocation Tool answered 'how much goes to retirement?' You have a number - your Multiply bucket. This tool answers the next question: 'Where does that money actually go?'"

3. **Preview the next step:** "And after this, Tool 8 will answer 'What do I invest in once it's in those accounts?' One step at a time."

4. **Why this order matters:** "You can't design a retirement structure until you know how much you're working with. You can't pick investments until you know which accounts you're using. Each tool builds on the last."

## Principle 1: The Retirement Account Menu (10 min)

1. **Normalize the confusion:** "If you've ever felt overwhelmed by all the account types - 401k, IRA, Roth, SEP, SIMPLE, HSA - you're not alone. The IRS didn't create these to confuse you. They created different tools for different situations."

2. **The key insight:** "There's no single 'best' account. A Solo 401(k) is incredible for a self-employed person with no employees - and completely unavailable to a W-2 worker. An HSA is the best tax deal in America - if you have a high-deductible health plan. Context is everything."

3. **Walk through the chart:** "Let's look at who each account is designed for, when it's NOT the right fit, and what goal it serves well." *(Use Account Menu chart)*

4. **Free Money First:** "One universal truth: if your employer matches your 401(k) contributions, that's the best return you'll ever get. A 50% match is a 50% instant return before your money is even invested. The tool always puts employer match first - for everyone, regardless of profile."

5. **Bridge to tool:** "The Retirement Blueprint looks at YOUR situation and filters this menu down. You won't see Solo 401(k) if you're a W-2 employee. You won't see HSA if you don't have an eligible health plan. The tool shows you YOUR menu."

---

## Principle 2: The Tax Timing Decision (10 min)

1. **Reframe the question:** "Traditional vs Roth isn't about avoiding taxes. You're going to pay taxes. The question is: do you want to pay them NOW or LATER?"

2. **Traditional in plain terms:** "Traditional means you skip taxes today - your contribution comes out before taxes, your paycheck is bigger. But when you withdraw in retirement, the IRS is waiting. You pay then."

3. **Roth in plain terms:** "Roth means you pay taxes today - your contribution comes from after-tax money. But then it grows tax-free, and when you withdraw in retirement, you owe nothing. It's already been taxed."

4. **The decision framework:** "If you're in a HIGH tax bracket now and expect to be LOWER in retirement, Traditional makes sense - pay later when your rate is lower. If you're in a LOW bracket now and expect it to be HIGHER later, Roth makes sense - pay now while it's cheap."

5. **The HSA cheat code:** "HSA is the exception. Tax-deductible going in. Grows tax-free. Withdrawals tax-free for medical expenses. It's the only triple-tax-advantage account. If you're eligible, it's almost always worth funding."

6. **Show the Tax Preference chart:** "When you tell the tool your preference, it reorders your entire waterfall. Watch how your choice changes the recommendations." *(Use Tax Preference chart)*

## Principle 3: The Waterfall (10 min)

1. **Break the equal-split myth:** "A common mistake is thinking you should spread your retirement savings evenly across accounts. A little here, a little there. That's not how this works."

2. **The waterfall concept:** "Instead, you fill accounts in priority order. Top priority account gets filled to its limit. THEN you move to the next. Money cascades down like a waterfall - it doesn't spray everywhere at once."

3. **Why order matters:** "The order matters because of tax treatment. You want the best tax advantages filled first. Employer match is free money - first. HSA is triple-tax-free - second. Then it depends on your profile and tax preference."

4. **Walk through the example:** "For a typical W-2 employee: First, 401(k) up to the match. Then HSA to the max. Then 401(k) Roth to $23,500. Then IRA Roth to $7,000. Only after all those are full does money go to a regular taxable account."

5. **The tool handles the limits:** "Each account has IRS limits. The tool knows all of them - including catch-up contributions if you're 50+. You don't have to memorize $23,500 or $7,000 or $8,550. The tool tracks it and tells you when a bucket is full."

## Principle 4: Your Profile Shapes Your Plan (8 min)

1. **Why profiles exist:** "Not everyone should follow the same waterfall. A business owner with employees has different options than a W-2 worker. Someone near retirement has different priorities than someone just starting out."

2. **The tool classifies you:** "Based on your answers - your work situation, your age, your tax preference, whether you have a Traditional IRA - the tool assigns you to one of 9 profiles. This isn't a personality test. It's a practical filter."

3. **Walk through the profiles:** "Let me show you the 9 profiles and why each one matters for the person in it." *(Use Profiles chart - focus on the 'Why This Matters' column)*

4. **Profiles determine your menu AND your order:** "Your profile affects two things: which accounts even show up as options, and what order they appear in your waterfall. A Solo Operator sees Solo 401(k) at the top. A Foundation Builder sees employer 401(k) at the top."

5. **Trust but verify:** "When you see your profile, ask yourself: does this feel right? If you're classified as a Foundation Builder but you actually have a side business with no employees, something might be off in your answers. The profile should make sense to you."

## Principle 5: ROBS - The Hyperfunding Strategy (10 min)

1. **Acknowledge the limits problem:** "If you're a business owner who feels behind on retirement, the standard limits can feel frustrating. $23,500 a year in a 401(k)? That's not going to catch you up if you're starting late."

2. **Introduce ROBS differently:** "You may have heard of ROBS as a way to use retirement funds to start a business. That's one use. But for our clients, we often use it in reverse - as a way to hyperfund retirement THROUGH your business."

3. **The real example:** "I'll use myself as an example. I run a C-corp that produces about $500,000 a year. My 401(k) owns 98% of the company through a ROBS structure. What does that mean? I contribute $100,000 to $200,000 a year into retirement. Compare that to the $23,500 limit everyone else faces."

4. **The math that matters:** "Standard 401(k) max: $23,500. With catch-up at 50+: $31,000. With ROBS: $100,000+. That's 3-6x the normal pace. For business owners who are behind, this is one of the most powerful tools available."

5. **The guardrails:** "This isn't for everyone. You need a C-corp structure. You need $50,000+ in rollover-eligible retirement funds to set it up. Your business needs to be profitable. There's more complexity and compliance. But for the right person, it's transformational."

## Principle 6: The Tool Listens to What Matters Most (8 min)

1. **Beyond accounts - domains:** "The tool doesn't just think about retirement accounts. It thinks about three domains: Retirement, Education, and Health. If you have kids, education savings might matter. If you're HSA-eligible, health savings is an option."

2. **The tool asks what matters to you:** "You'll be asked to rate importance on a 1-7 scale. How important is retirement to you right now? How important is education savings? This isn't busy work - those numbers directly affect how your budget gets split."

3. **Importance plus urgency:** "The tool combines two things: how important you SAY something is, and how SOON you need it. If your kid starts college in 3 years, that's more urgent than retirement in 25 years. The tool weights accordingly."

4. **Walk through the chart:** "Let me show you how different answers change the tool's behavior." *(Use Ambition Quotient chart)*

5. **You break the tie:** "If all three domains score similarly, the tool asks a tie-breaker question. It doesn't guess - it asks you to choose. Then it gives your choice a 10% boost. You're in control."

---

## Closing: What Happens Next (5 min)

1. **The trust message:** "This tool exists because the complexity of retirement accounts keeps people frozen. Too many options, too many rules, too many 'it depends' answers. The tool does the hard work so you don't have to."

2. **Your job vs the tool's job:** "Your job is to answer honestly about your situation. The tool's job is to translate that into a clear, prioritized plan. You bring the truth about your life. The tool brings the knowledge of IRS rules, limits, and strategies."

3. **The timeline:** "You'll get access to the tool on Monday. Take your time with it. Answer thoughtfully. Next Wednesday, we'll have a Q&A session where you can ask about your results."

4. **Seeds for next week:** "As you use the tool, notice three things: What profile did it assign you - does it feel right? What's the waterfall order it recommends - anything surprising? How did your importance ratings affect the split between domains? Come ready to ask 'why did it recommend X for me?'"

5. **Final encouragement:** "You've done harder work than this in Tools 1-5. This is the payoff - turning that self-knowledge into a concrete structure. Trust the process. Trust the tool. And trust yourself to answer honestly."
