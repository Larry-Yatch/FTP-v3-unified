---

## FOR AI CODER: Start Here

**Before doing anything else:**
1. Read the "Current Status & Next Steps" section (bottom of this doc)
2. Read the "Session Handoff Protocol" section to see what was done last
3. Check the Sprint Checklist to see what's complete vs pending
4. THEN read the relevant spec sections for the current sprint

**When ending your session:**
1. Update "Session Handoff Protocol" with what you did
2. Update "Sprint Checklist" checkboxes
3. Add any new decisions to "Key Decisions Made"
4. Note any blockers or issues discovered

---

## Quick Start (Read This First)

### 1. Primary Specification Document
```
docs/Tool6/Tool6-Consolidated-Specification.md (v1.4)
```
This is the **single source of truth**. It contains:
- All algorithms with code blocks
- 32 sprints across 10 phases
- Test cases for each sprint
- Reference patterns from Tool 4

### 2. Existing Implementation
```
tools/tool6/
├── Tool6.js              # Main tool - basic skeleton implemented
├── Tool6Constants.js     # COMPLETE - all IRS limits, profiles, vehicles
└── tool6.manifest.json   # COMPLETE - tool metadata
```

### 3. Reference Implementation (Copy Patterns From)
```
tools/tool4/Tool4.js      # Same architecture, copy patterns for:
                          # - checkToolCompletion()
                          # - savePreSurvey() / getPreSurvey()
                          # - saveScenario()
                          # - buildUnifiedPage()
```

### 4. Legacy Code (Algorithm Reference Only)
```
apps/Tool-6-retirement-blueprint-tool/scripts/
├── code.js               # 170KB - allocation algorithms, FV calculations
└── Document_Narratives.js # Personalized messaging patterns
```
**Warning:** Do NOT copy legacy code directly. Use spec algorithms which fix known bugs.

**Data Flow:**
1. Tools 1-5 data pulled → Pre-populate fields
2. User answers 7-20 questions → Profile classification
3. Ambition Quotient calculated → Domain weights
4. Waterfall allocation → Vehicle recommendations
5. User adjusts sliders → Real-time recalculation
6. Save scenario → TOOL6_SCENARIOS sheet

---

## Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Monthly Budget Source
Tool 4's `multiply` field = Monthly retirement savings budget (M bucket from M/E/F/J)
```javascript
const monthlyBudget = toolStatus.tool4Data?.multiply || 0;
```

### 2. Profile Classification (9 Profiles)
Decision tree - first match wins. See spec section "Profile Classification System".

### 3. Ambition Quotient (Phase C)
Weights allocation across Retirement/Education/Health domains based on:
- **Importance**: 1-7 scale rating per domain
- **Anxiety**: 1-7 scale rating per domain
- **Motivation**: 1-7 scale rating per domain
- **Time-discounted urgency**: Using monthly discount rate formula
- **Tie-breaker**: Asked only when all 3 domains are active

**Adaptive Logic**: Only asks about active domains:
- Retirement: Always asked (3 questions)
- Education: Only if hasChildren = Yes (3 questions)
- Health: Only if hsaEligible = Yes (3 questions)
- Tie-breaker: Only if all 3 domains active (1 question)

### 4. Waterfall Allocation
1. Non-discretionary seeds first (employer match)
2. Domain budgets from Ambition Quotient
3. Leftover cascade: Education → Health → Retirement
4. Overflow to Taxable Brokerage (Family Bank)

### 5. Shared Limits
- 401(k) Traditional + Roth share $23,500 limit
- IRA Traditional + Roth share $7,000 limit
- Sliders must enforce combined limits

### 6. HSA Coverage Inference
Inferred from filing status (added in v1.4):
- MFJ → Family ($8,550/yr)
- Single/MFS → Individual ($4,300/yr)

### 7. Questionnaire Summary (24 Questions)

| Section | Questions | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Core (9) | Q1-Q9 | Q7 conditional on Q6=Yes, Q8 conditional on Q5=Yes |
| ROBS Qualifiers (3) | Q10-Q12 | Only show if Q4="Interested" (not "Yes") |
| Education Domain (4) | Q13-Q16 | Q14-Q15 conditional on Q13=Yes |
| Current Balances (4) | Q17-Q20 | Q17 on Q5=Yes, Q19 on Q9=Yes, Q20 on Q13=Yes |
| Current Contributions (4) | Q21-Q24 | Q21 on Q5=Yes, Q23 on Q9=Yes, Q24 on Q13=Yes |

**Education Domain Design:** "Combined CESA" approach - tracks total education savings across ALL children (529, Coverdell ESA, UTMA), not per-child accounts.

## Critical Files to Read Before Coding

| Priority | File | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| 1 | `docs/Tool6/Tool6-Consolidated-Specification.md` | Complete spec with all algorithms |
| 2 | `docs/Middleware/middleware-mapping.md` | **Data structure reference for Tools 1-5** |
| 3 | `tools/tool6/Tool6Constants.js` | All constants already implemented |
| 4 | `tools/tool6/Tool6.js` | Current implementation state |
| 5 | `tools/tool4/Tool4.js` | Reference patterns (same architecture) |
| 6 | `CLAUDE.md` | GAS navigation rules (CRITICAL) |

---

## GAS Navigation Rules (MUST FOLLOW)

From CLAUDE.md - **NEVER** use:
```javascript
// WRONG - Will break in GAS
window.location.reload();
window.location.href = '...';
```

**ALWAYS** use:
```javascript
// CORRECT - GAS pattern
google.script.run
  .withSuccessHandler(function(result) {
    if (result && result.nextPageHtml) {
      document.open();
      document.write(result.nextPageHtml);
      document.close();
      window.scrollTo(0, 0);
    }
  })
  .serverFunction(params);
```

### Phase 11: UX Improvements (Student-Friendly)
> **Reference:** `docs/Tool6/Tool6-UI-Improvements.md` for full details, reasoning, and Tool 4/5 pattern comparison

#### Sprint 11.1: Foundation & Navigation (Mirror Tool 4/5)
- [x] **BUG FIX:** Solo 401(k) Roth not updating tax treatment graph - ✅ **FIXED** (Jan 24, 2026)
- [x] **BUG FIX:** Backup questions save not working - ✅ **FIXED** (Jan 24, 2026) - Fixed field name mismatches for all 3 tiers
- [ ] Add Return to Dashboard button (top of page, gold `.btn-nav` style like Tool 4)
- [ ] Add Get Help button (use FeedbackWidget from Tool 5)
- [ ] Implement Tool 4-style guided walkthrough (auto-open/close sections)
- [ ] Add section headers with icons (📊 Profile, 💼 Details, ⚖️ Priorities, 💰 Allocation)
- [ ] Apply transparent card backgrounds (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03)`)

#### Sprint 11.2: Profile & Flow Improvements
- [ ] Create persistent profile banner (shows after classification)
- [ ] Separate profile classification into distinct section
- [ ] Skip Phase C (Ambition Quotient) when only Retirement domain applies
- [ ] Add collapsible section summaries (show values when collapsed, like Tool 4)

#### Sprint 11.3: Educational Content
- [ ] Add welcome/intro section (explain tool purpose, time estimate, data sources)
- [ ] Add tax strategy explanation (Roth vs Traditional - THE key decision)
- [ ] Add investment score explanation (what 1-7 means, 8%-20% returns)
- [ ] Add scenario management instructions
- [ ] Add slider behavior explanation (coupled limits, lock buttons)

#### Sprint 11.4: Progress & Actions

- [ ] Move action buttons to top of calculator section
- [ ] Investigate/clarify recalculate button purpose
- [ ] Add plain English results summary ("What This Means")

#### Sprint 11.5: SKIP (Not Implementing)
- ~~Jargon tooltips~~ - Time-consuming, minimal value
- ~~Wizard-style Phase B~~ - Major restructure, slows experienced users
- ~~Profile reveal celebration~~ - Polish only
- ~~Domain weight transparency~~ - Could confuse more than help
- ~~Auto-save draft~~ - Single-page tool, less needed

## Current Status & Next Steps

### What's Done (Phase 0 Complete)

| Sprint | Status | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 0.1 Directory & Manifest | ✅ Complete | `tools/tool6/` exists, `tool6.manifest.json` complete |
| 0.2 Skeleton & Registration | ✅ Complete | `Tool6.js` exists, registered in `Code.js:177-199` |
| 0.3 Basic Page Layout | ✅ Complete | `buildUnifiedPage()` with 4 collapsible sections |

**Tool6Constants.js** - FULLY COMPLETE with:
- All IRS 2025 limits (401k, IRA, HSA, catch-ups, phase-outs)
- 9 profile definitions with characteristics
- Vehicle definitions with tax treatment and limits
- Vehicle priority order by profile
- Domain definitions (Retirement/Education/Health/Overflow)
- Projection config, tax strategy options, employer match formulas

**Tool6.js** - Skeleton with working patterns:
- `render()` - Returns full HTML page with styles
- `checkToolCompletion()` - Pulls Tools 1-5 data via DataService
- `getPreSurvey()` / `savePreSurvey()` - Pre-survey persistence
- `getPrefillData()` - Extracts age, income, budget from Tool 2/4
- `classifyProfile()` - **STUB** returns Profile 7 (needs Sprint 2)
- `calculateAllocation()` - **STUB** returns empty (needs Sprint 4)
- `buildUnifiedPage()` - 4 collapsible sections with placeholder content
- `renderError()` - Error page rendering

### What's NOT Done

| Component | Status | Sprint |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Upstream data field mapping | Partial | 1.1 |
| Backup questions UI | Not started | 1.2 |
| TOOL6_SCENARIOS sheet | Not started | 1.3 |
| Profile classification logic | Stub only | 2.1-2.4 |
| Ambition Quotient | Not started | 3.1-3.2 |
| Waterfall allocation | Stub only | 4.1-4.5 |
| Vehicle sliders | Not started | 5.5 |
| Projections engine | Not started | 6.1-6.3 |
| Scenario save/load/compare | Stub only | 7.1-7.4 |
| GPT integration | Not started | 9.1-9.2 |

### Next Session: Start Phase 1

**Sprint 1.1: Upstream Data Pull**

Goal: Map all fields from Tools 1-5 per spec Data Sources table

Tasks:
1. Update `checkToolCompletion()` to return mapped fields:
   ```javascript
   return {
     // Existing flags
     hasTool1, hasTool2, hasTool3, hasTool4, hasTool5,
     // NEW: Mapped fields per spec
     age: tool2Data?.age,
     income: tool2Data?.income,
     employmentType: tool2Data?.employmentType,
     businessOwner: tool2Data?.businessOwner,
     filingStatus: tool2Data?.maritalStatus === 'Married' ? 'MFJ' : 'Single',
     monthlyTakeHome: tool4Data?.monthlyIncome,
     yearsToRetirement: tool4Data?.goalTimeline,
     monthlyBudget: tool4Data?.multiply,
     investmentScore: tool4Data?.investmentScore || 4,
     traumaPattern: tool1Data?.winningPattern,
     // ... etc
   };
   ```
2. Create `getDataStatus(clientId)` to return availability summary
3. Update `buildUnifiedPage()` to show status badges (green/yellow/red)

Test Cases:
- Client with all Tool 1-5 data → all fields populated, green badges
- Client with partial data → some fields null, yellow badges
- New client → all null, red badges

Reference: Spec section "Data Sources" (lines 96-111) and "Cross-Tool Data Pull"

---

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Navigate to tool in browser
# Add ?route=tool6&clientId=TEST001 to your GAS web app URL

# Check for forbidden navigation patterns before committing
grep -rn "window.location.reload\|location.reload" tools/tool6/

# Check for escaped apostrophe issues in template literals
grep -n "\\\\'.*message:" tools/tool6/
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Tool 4 is REQUIRED
Tool 6 cannot function without Tool 4 data (monthly budget comes from there).
```javascript
if (!toolStatus.hasTool4 || monthlyBudget <= 0) {
  throw new Error('Tool 4 must be completed first');
}
```

### 2. Employer Match is Non-Discretionary
Employer match does NOT come from user's budget - it's "free money".
- Add to allocation display separately
- Does count against 401(k) total limit

### 3. HSA Catch-Up Age is 55, Not 50
Different from retirement accounts!

### 4. Shared Limits Between Vehicles
401(k) Trad + Roth = $23,500 combined
IRA Trad + Roth = $7,000 combined

### 5. Template Literal Apostrophes
In GAS with document.write(), avoid escaped apostrophes:
```javascript
// BAD - will break
message: 'You\'re at ' + value

// GOOD - use full words
message: 'You are at ' + value
```

## Cross-Session Memory

### Using This Document
This startup doc serves as persistent memory across sessions. **Always update the "Session Handoff Protocol" section before ending a session.**

### Key Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| HSA coverage inferred from filing status | Avoids extra question; MFJ=Family, Single/MFS=Individual | Jan 9, 2026 |
| Tool 4 is REQUIRED (no backup) | Monthly budget must come from Tool 4's M bucket allocation | Jan 9, 2026 |
| Profile 7 is default | Foundation Builder is the catch-all for standard W-2 employees | Jan 9, 2026 |
| Use spec algorithms, not legacy code | Legacy has known bugs (e.g., Profile 8 classification) | Jan 9, 2026 |
| **Always consult middleware-mapping.md** | Canonical reference for tool data structures; prevents data path bugs | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **Gross Income & Years to Retirement must be asked in Tool 6** | Tool 2 only has clarity scores (not dollar amounts); Tool 4 goalTimeline is categorical goal priority, not retirement years | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **Education uses "Combined CESA" approach** | Track total education savings across ALL children (529, Coverdell ESA, UTMA), not per-child accounts; matches legacy Tool 6 and simplifies UI | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **ROBS qualifiers only for "Interested"** | If user already uses ROBS ("Yes"), they don't need qualification questions; qualifiers only show for "Interested" | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **Combined balances (no Trad/Roth split)** | Keep 401k and IRA balances combined for MVP; Tool 6 allocates FUTURE contributions, not existing funds; same growth rate for projections; can add "Advanced Mode" later if needed | Jan 11, 2026 |
| **Tax preference asked for ALL profiles** | Required for allocation calculations - determines Roth vs Traditional prioritization. Previously only asked as classification tie-breaker for W-2 employees. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Rich Ambition Quotient over simple ranking** | Legacy algorithm used 9 questions (importance/anxiety/motivation per domain) + 3 tie-breakers. Simple 1-2-3 ranking lacked psychological depth. Adaptive design skips irrelevant domains. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Always render Phase A (hidden when profile exists)** | Fixes bug where "Change" button did nothing. Elements must exist in DOM for JS handlers to work. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Coupled sliders use ORIGINAL proportions** | When one slider moves, redistribute delta among others using ORIGINAL algorithm proportions, not current amounts. Preserves algorithm's intelligence. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Zero vehicles can re-enter at original proportion** | When user sets vehicle to $0, it's effectively "paused". Moving it up re-enters it with its original algorithm-calculated proportion. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Locked vehicles excluded from redistribution** | Locked sliders don't participate in coupled adjustment. Remaining unlocked vehicles' proportions are renormalized. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Store IRS limits separately from effective limits** | IRS limits are static per vehicle. Effective limits = min(IRS limit, budget). When budget changes, recalculate effective limits and update slider max values. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Education vehicle choice (529 vs Coverdell)** | User selects preferred vehicle: 529 (no income limit, college), Coverdell ($2k/child, K-12+college), or Both. Dynamic Coverdell limit = $2,000 × numChildren. | Jan 17, 2026 |
| **Family Bank is overflow (lowest priority)** | When increasing a vehicle, pull from Family Bank first. When decreasing, redistribute to other vehicles first (up to their limits), only overflow goes to Family Bank. | Jan 17, 2026 |

### Design Patterns Established
1. **Single-page calculator** - Same as Tool 4, not multi-phase like Tools 1-3
2. **Pre-survey → Calculate → Adjust** - User answers questions, gets recommendation, can adjust with sliders
3. **Server-side classification, client-side recalc** - Heavy lifting on server, sliders are instant JS
4. **Scenario persistence** - Save to TOOL6_SCENARIOS sheet, load/compare later

### UI Style Alignment with Tool 4

**CRITICAL:** All UI components must match Tool 4 patterns for consistency. See spec section "UI Style Requirements (Tool 4 Alignment)" for full details.

| Pattern | Tool 4 Way | NOT This |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Submit button | `.submit-btn` (gold, pill shape) | `.btn-primary` (purple, square) |
| Form input background | `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` |
| Loading overlay | Static HTML + `.show` class toggle | Dynamically created element |
| Error messages | `.error-message` + `.show` class | Inline `style.display` |
| Button disable | `disabled = true` + `opacity = 0.5` | Just `disabled` |

**Reference files:**
- `tools/tool4/Tool4.js` - Lines 1393-1479 (CSS), Lines 4483-4534 (JS patterns)

## Session Handoff Protocol

When ending a session, update this section:

### Last Session Summary
- **Date:** January 24, 2026
- **What was done:**
  - ✅ **Sprint 10.1: Backup Questions System**
  - Implemented 3-tier backup questions when prerequisite tool data is missing:
    - **Tier 1 (Tool 4 missing):** Monthly income, monthly budget, years to retirement, investment risk
    - **Tier 2 (Tool 2 missing):** Age, gross income, employment type, filing status
    - **Tier 3 (Tool 1 missing):** 3 trauma pattern questions (majority voting)
  - New method: `buildBackupQuestionsHtml(savedAnswers, hasTool1, hasTool2, hasTool4)`
  - New derivation functions:
    - `deriveTool4FromBackup()` - Extracts financial data from backup answers
    - `deriveTool2FromBackup()` - Extracts demographics from backup answers
    - `deriveTraumaPatternFromBackup()` - Majority voting across 3 questions
    - `mergeBackupData()` - Integrates derived data into toolStatus
  - New CSS: `.backup-questions-section`, `.backup-tier`, `.backup-statement-group` styles
  - New JS functions: `updateBackupSlider()`, `selectBackupScore()`, `selectBackupStatement()`, `navigateToTool()`
  - Updated `buildQuestionnaireHtml()` to accept toolStatus parameter
  - Updated `render()` and `savePreSurvey()` to call `mergeBackupData()`
- **Current state:** Sprint 10.1 Complete. Users can now proceed without Tool 1, 2, or 4 by answering backup questions.
- **Next task:** Sprint 10.2 - Edge Cases
- **Blockers:** None

### Previous Session (January 24, 2026 AM)
- ✅ Sprint 8.1: Trauma Integration - Trauma Insights Display

- GPT integration with trauma-informed context and 3-tier fallback

### Earlier Session (January 17, 2026 PM)
- ✅ Phase 6 Complete - Projections Engine
- Server-side: `calculatePersonalizedRate()`, `futureValue()`, `calculateProjections()`
- Client-side real-time updates, tax breakdown visualization

### Earlier Session (January 17, 2026 AM)
- ✅ Phase 5 Complete - Calculator UI with coupled sliders
- Vehicle sliders, investment score, tax strategy, employer match display
- Coupled slider behavior, lock/unlock, budget editing, reset to recommended

### Earlier Session (January 16, 2026)
- ✅ Phase 4 Complete - Vehicle Allocation Engine
- `getEligibleVehicles()`, `getVehiclePriorityOrder()`, `coreAllocate()`, `validateAllocations()`
- Waterfall allocation, shared limits, non-discretionary seeds

- ✅ Phase 3 Complete - Three-Phase Questionnaire with Ambition Quotient
- Added `AMBITION_QUESTIONS`, `computeDomainsAndWeights()`, Phase C UI
- Added `a2b_taxPreference` to Phase B for all profiles

### Decision Tree Order (Legacy Aligned)
```
Profile 1 (ROBS in use)
  → Profile 2 (ROBS interested + qualifies)
    → Profile 3 (Business owner + employees)
      → Profile 4 (Self-employed/Both, no employees)
        → Profile 5 (Has Traditional IRA)
          → Profile 9 (age >= 55 OR nearRetirement)
            → Profile 6 (age >= 50 AND catchUpFeeling)
              → Profile 8 (taxFocus = Now/Both)
                → Profile 7 (default)
```

### ✅ RESOLVED: Data Not Mapping from Tools 1-5 (Jan 11, 2026)

**Root Cause Identified:**
Different tools save data with different nesting structures:
- **Tool 1** saves: `{ formData, scores, winner }` → access via `.data.winner`, `.data.scores`
- **Tools 2/3/5** save: `{ data: formData, results, scoring }` → form data at `.data.data` (double-nested)
- **Tool 4** saves flat: `{ scenarioName, multiply, monthlyIncome }` → access via `.data` directly
- **Tool 3/5 subdomain scores** are at `scoring.subdomainQuotients`, NOT `results.subdomainScores`

**Fix Applied in `mapUpstreamFields()` (lines 138-215):**
```javascript
// Extract actual form/result data from each response
const t1Raw = tool1Data?.data || {};
const t1Winner = t1Raw.winner || t1Raw.winningPattern || null;
const t1Scores = t1Raw.scores || {};

const t2 = tool2Data?.data?.data || {};
const t3 = tool3Data?.data?.data || {};
const t3Scoring = tool3Data?.data?.scoring || {};  // subdomainQuotients here
const t4 = tool4Data?.data || {};  // Tool 4 saves flat
const t5 = tool5Data?.data?.data || {};
const t5Scoring = tool5Data?.data?.scoring || {};  // subdomainQuotients here
```

**Key Discovery:**
The `docs/Middleware/middleware-mapping.md` document is the **canonical reference** for all tool data structures. Always consult it when pulling cross-tool data.

### Notes for Next Session

## Sprint 10.1 - Backup Questions System Complete

**Sprint 10.1 Complete:** Users can now proceed without Tool 1, 2, or 4 by answering backup questions.

### Backup Questions Architecture (Jan 24, 2026)
- **3-tier approach:** Tool 4 (critical), Tool 2 (important), Tool 1 (trauma insights)
- **UI Pattern:** Yellow gradient section at top of questionnaire, similar to Tool 4 approach
- **Navigate buttons:** Users can go complete the original tools instead
- **Derivation functions:** Process backup answers into toolStatus-compatible data

### New Server-Side Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `buildBackupQuestionsHtml()` | Builds backup questions UI |
| `deriveTool4FromBackup()` | Extracts: monthlyIncome, monthlyBudget, yearsToRetirement, investmentScore |
| `deriveTool2FromBackup()` | Extracts: age, grossIncome, employmentType, filingStatus |
| `deriveTraumaPatternFromBackup()` | Majority voting across 3 questions |
| `mergeBackupData()` | Integrates derived data into toolStatus |
| `getInvestmentScoreLabel()` | Returns score description |

### New Client-Side Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `updateBackupSlider()` | Updates slider display and track fill |
| `selectBackupScore()` | Handles 1-7 score button selection |
| `selectBackupStatement()` | Handles radio button cards |
| `navigateToTool()` | Redirects to Tool 1, 2, or 4 |
| `initBackupSliders()` | Initializes slider states on page load |

### New CSS Classes
- `.backup-questions-section` - Yellow gradient container
- `.backup-tier` - Individual tier section
- `.backup-statement-group` - Radio button cards
- `.backup-score-buttons` - Investment score buttons

## Next Steps

**Sprint 10.2: Edge Cases**
- Test backup questions with various missing tool combinations
- Verify allocation calculations with backup-derived data
- Test navigation between tools

**Recommendation:** Test the backup questions system thoroughly before production.

## Projection Functions Reference

| Function | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `calculatePersonalizedRate(score)` | Tool6.js:1412 | Score 1-7 → 8%-20% return |
| `futureValue(pmt, rate, years)` | Tool6.js:1428 | FV with safeguards |
| `calculateProjections(inputs)` | Tool6.js:1477 | Retirement projections |
| `calculateEducationProjections(inputs)` | Tool6.js:1550 | Education projections |
| `calculateTaxBreakdown(alloc, proj)` | Tool6.js:1607 | Tax-free vs taxable split |
| `calculateCompleteProjections(...)` | Tool6.js:1663 | Combines all projections |

## Client-Side Projection Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `calculateClientProjections()` | Mirrors server logic for instant UI updates |
| `updateProjectionDisplay()` | Updates all projection DOM elements |
| `calculatePersonalizedRate(score)` | Client-side return rate calculation |
| `futureValue(pmt, rate, years)` | Client-side FV calculation |

## Coupled Slider Reference (for maintenance)

### Redistribution Logic (Family Bank aware)
- **INCREASE vehicle**: Pull from Family Bank first (lowest priority), then other vehicles
- **DECREASE vehicle**: Redistribute to other vehicles first (up to limits), overflow to Family Bank

### State Object
```javascript
var allocationState = {
  vehicles: {},           // Current amounts
  originalAllocation: {}, // Algorithm output (for proportions)
  limits: {},             // Effective max (min of IRS and budget)
  irsLimits: {},          // True IRS limits
  locked: {},             // Lock status
  budget: 0,
  originalBudget: 0
};
```
