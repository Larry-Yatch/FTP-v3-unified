# Financial TruPath v3 - Active TODOs


---

Bugs:
- Add access to the investment tool - tool 8 now
- Tool 5: last two domains have the same consequence look into that
- discard draft in mid-draft does not actually discard draft it just takes you back to the main menu then you have to discard draft there.
- overall can we make the back button in browser work right - for now it just takes you back to the login screen

- add "Attended by Watching" to admin panel - count toward participated

Tool 7
- the trust open response question is weak 
- Check for the questions that seem too similar in both the first and second pages. 
- Is there a trust people we shouldn't or just trust people we should section? 

Future features:
- add persistance over time and trends over time
