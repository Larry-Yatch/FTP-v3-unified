# Financial TruPath v3 - Active TODOs

Tool 6:
- Do we need to tie a ROBS suggestion to anyone that falls into the late-stage growth or the catch-up profiles? Those profiles are specifically focused on catching up and using ROBS in a reverse order to hyperfund the retirement is one of the best strategies. So we might add that if they get classified as that, we ask them some questions around should they be interested or qualify for a ROBS structure? 

- When it comes to I think it's 401ks, you have the ability to do I think solo 401k's have the ability to do profit distributions above the limitation based on salary. Have we accounted for that in here when we're calculating limits? Can we do that? Check tool4 legacy

- How are we dealing with Backdoor roth - check tool4 legacy

Bugs:
- Add access to the investment tool - tool 8 now
- Tool 5: last two domains have the same consequence look into that
- discard draft in mid-draft does not actually discard draft it just takes you back to the main menu then you have to discard draft there.
- overall can we make the back button in browser work right - for now it just takes you back to the login screen

- add "Attended by Watching" to admin panel - count toward participated

Tool 7
- the trust open response question is weak 
- Check for the questions that seem too similar in both the first and second pages. 
- Is there a trust people we shouldn't or just trust people we should section? 

Future features:
- add persistance over time and trends over time
