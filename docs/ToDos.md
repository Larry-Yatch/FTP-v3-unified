# Financial TruPath v3 - Active TODOs

- Valeria - tool4 wrong profile suggested - stuck on get out of debt
- add 8 to admin 


- add "Attended by Watching" to admin panel - count toward participated

Tool 6:
- can we make it so that the user can select what scenario they pull from , we should default to the latest one


Tool 8

- there is a possiblity that we should rebuild this tool in the future to make it a more useful investment calculator.  Instead of having it just focused on retirement investing we could make it universal so that it could be used to build a full investment plan.

Meaning it could use an ambition tool to guide someone through all of the options to build the right plan for cashflow today verses retirement value.

As well as all the variables that change the plan such as: Foundational strategies for investing
- short long term
- cash flow - end term value
- taxes - now later
- risk vs return - types domains of investing
- Accredited / unaccredited

Future features:
- add persistance over time and trends over time

- integratae spousal account dynamically
