         3. Loop  
            1. This starts with the feeling of being obligated to another for something they have done/given to us, which at the core we do not feel worthy to receive, therefore we must earn it through sacrificing and taking care of them  
            2. This whole loop is about wanting to feel connected to another but using our feelings of obligation to drive overworking which creates feelings of isolation.

         2. I must rely on someone else for my financial safety  
            1. I am insufficient on my own \- which creates dependence \- and ultimately is an attempt to be attached \- ie not left yet ensures that I am never really worthy of unconditional love  
            2. Two versions of this dependence on another  
               1. Actual dependence \- where create situations where I am dependent on another to take care of my needs

            1. The need for independence drives the dependence  
            2. I do not want to burden others, but I create situations where I have to rely on them, which justifies my false view of my insufficiency, but ensures I am connected to them through dependence  
         4. Types of reliance \- Exercise \- ways that we give up our power   
            1. Actual Financial dependence  
               1. Who

            1. From a place of fear from scarcity, and a view on not being worthy, we illustrate control over our insufficient financial situation by self-imposing suffering and ensuring we go without  
            2. Two versions of this  
               1. Never spending on ourselves  
                  1. In this one, we know that we cannot spend on ourselves as that would be selfish and irresponsible as there will not be enough  
               2. Overspending on ourselves  
                  1. In this version, we need to end up in the same place of scarcity and it is driven by the same low self-worth we show that by overspending on things that we do not really need so that there will not be money when we really need it and we can be to blame for that scarcity  
         3. Loop  
            1. There is not enough, there will not be enough because I am not able to make enough, therefore I will be irresponsible (in not spending or spending) to ensure there is not enough for me.

         1. Driver \- Low self-worth \- all three?  
         2. I trusted someone I should not / I should have known better / I did not protect myself in a deal  
            1. In this, we must ensure that we have an unpredictable environment that we cannot control.  We have to make sure that they will not be financially safe.  
         3. Loop  
            1. The world is unpredictable and we will be hurt by it, so we do something that we know we shouldn't to ensure the negative outcome that validates our unpredictable expectation, giving ourselves a good dose of “I told you so” to support our underlying low self-worth.  
         4. Types of ways we produce unpredictability

      3. Call 2 \- SQ/IQ \- Small Group  
         1. 2 Phases   
            1. Phase 1: Financial SQ \- Awareness  
               1. We leverage digital worksheets to bring your awareness to your literal financial practices.  
                  1. These worksheets are designed to give you absolute clarity on what practices/habits/skills you have that support your financial journey and where you have shortcomings or bad habits  
            2. Phase 2: Financial IQ \- Action  
               1. We will make steps towards financial freedom by guiding you through the steps necessary to create the future you want.  
               2. There will be two parts to this  
                  1. On-call work \- specific work to get you set up to take action  
                  2. Homework \- detailed work to implement the action steps you set up on the call  
                     1. We do this to ensure that your specific financial data stays safe  
                     2. We are also never stepping into the financial advisor role  
                     3. We will be responsible for accountability for your actions  
      4. Describe the benefits of the 3 phases and who it will help and reinforce that there will always be value to the student  
         1. Phase 1: FSQ \- AWARENESS \- benefits the person who does not understand why they are stuck  
            1. You may not be stuck in this mindset \- the assessments will tell you if this is a required area of focus or not  
         2. Phase 2: FEQ \- PURPOSE \- benefits the person that is not stuck in this area \- if your assessment comes back green  
            1. The fact that these truths/skills are universal means that even if you do not have an ineffective mindset you will gain value in your life  
         3. Phase 3: FIQ \- ACTION \- benefits the person who has not developed the practical behaviors that support their journey to financial freedom.  
            1. These are actual skills that move the needle in your financial world.  
            2. These will either give you confidence that you are doing the right thing or give you the opportunity to move the needle in your actual financial world  
4. Expectations  
   1. Data-centric \- FSQ \- the foundation of behavior change  
      1. Behavior Change Cycle  
         1. observation/awareness → mindset (Truth or truth) → choice (subconscious / conscious) → Action → Environment  
      2. Our most valuable resource \- Our focus and attention  
         1. It is how we channel our divine power  
         2. Where there is light there is no dark, light cannot exist without dark but the dark has no power over the light, only in blocking the light can dark exist.  
         3. Our financial traumas/strategies can only exist in the darkness of our ignorance \- when we direct the light of our attention and focus the dark goes away.  
         4. Therefore, it is our responsibility to direct your attention into the dark corners of your financial trauma \- we do that through workshops  
      3. This data enables you to know where you are hiding from yourself and ensuring that you stay stuck  
      4. This is not always comfortable, but it always works.  
         1. It is ok to feel emotions that we do not necessarily like while we gain clarity  
            1. Guilt, shame, frustration, anger, worry, fear \- are all emotions that you may experience as you shine the light in the dark corners.  
            2. Remember that it is in the light of your awareness that these emotions will dissipate.  
            3. How to process them  
               1. Experience them  
               2. Check-in on why they are showing up \- what are they telling us  
               3. Share with another \- you are not alone \- these feelings would make you think you are safer to isolate \- that is a lie  
               4. Ask for help \- there is endless help available to you in the class and this community  
   2. This course is significantly more than for just learning  
      1. Yes you will learn, but the power of this course comes through gaining awareness and taking action  
      2. Enabling both awareness and action is our responsibility to support you, but it is your responsibility to show up and follow up  
   3. What does this all mean?  
      1. The small group calls are the most important  
      2. Show up in a place where you can work \- avoid doing it in a car or while cooking dinner  
      3. Do everything you can to complete the exercises on the call do not give your subconscious the opportunity to sabotage you by tricking you into thinking you will do it later.  
      4. Safety valve \- redo  
      5. The exercises support each other but do not rely on each other, so if you miss one no big deal just show up to the next one.  
      6. Safety valve \- 1-on-1 facilitator support on an as needed basis at a per call cost \- $197 \- offer package of 6 $997  
5. Final Narratives   
   1. Where trauma comes from  
      1. Lesson that is no longer useful \- tie it back to Truth and truth  
      2. Point of this is giving themselves grace for what they fine when they look in the dark corners  
6. Discussion of current fears of participation  
   1. What are the fears that you are feeling?  
   2. What are the perceived obstacles that you fear will stop you?

5. Trauma Terms Defined  
   1. Perceived loss of control drives a parasympathetic response  
   2. If we survive, we learn \- something becomes True  
   3. If our environment stays the same, we have a useful lesson, and it stays True  
   4. If our environment changes then it becomes what was true becomes untrue  
   5. The paradox of free will shows us that we can hold anything to be True but then require ourselves to act in accordance with that truth  
   6. When we live in untruth we bring stress into our worlds and that is PTSD  
   7. Therefore, Trauma is merely an outdated strategy for survival  
6. The 6 Core Trauma Strategies  
   1. Disconnection  
      1. Where there is the experience of fear there is no experience of love.  Where there is the experience of love there is no experience of fear.  
      2. Trauma is always produced in fear therefore it is always a strategy based on disconnection  
      3. In the distillation of thousands of traumatic strategies they all regressed down to 3 types of disconnection  
         1. Disconnection from Self  
         2. Disconnection from Others  
         3. Disconnection from All That is Greater Than Us  
      4. Based on the Trinity of Connection/Love this means that all strategies of Trauma are strategies that shield us from love.

         Which is why these strategies never bring us safety as connection/love is the only pathway to safety for a human  
      5. These 3 pathways to disconnection manifest in both active and passive forms creating 6 Core Strategies of Trauma  
   2. 6 Strategies  
      1. Separation from Self

            1. Holding a false view of yourself as a shield

      2. Separation from Others

            1. Suffering and sacrificing to show love  
         2. Issues with Receiving Love  
            1. Inability to receive love  
      3. Separation from All that is greater than us

            1. Having to control everything in order to stay safe that leads to isolation  
         2. Fear leading to isolation  
            1. Having no control over anything and never feeling safe that leads to isolation  
7. 6 Core Strategies of Financial Trauma  
   1. Method of discovery  
      1. Financial mini-intensives  
         1. Same statement were used call to call  
            1. I knew better  
            2. I will just screw it up  
            3. I couldn’t believe…  
            4. One bad decision after another  
            5. I let them down  
            6. I should be saving  
            7. I cannot take a loss \- my life is over  
            8. I cannot be a burden on them \- I have to take care of myself \- suffering  
         2. After consolidating over 50 of these statements I collated them and regressed them and they regressed into 6 buckets \-  
         3. Each strategy designed to keep ourselves limited financially  
   2. Strategies  
      1. I will never have enough / I am not worthy of financial freedom / I am not good with money  
      2. Misrepresentation of your financial situation \- If someone sees my true financial situation (low or high) they will judge and reject me.  
      3. I must suffer and sacrifice in order to take care of the financial obligations of others   
      4. I must rely on someone else for my financial safety  
      5. Self-imposed suffering / going without  
      6. I trusted someone I should not / I should have known better / I did not protect myself in a deal  
   3. How do these line up with the 6 core Strategies of Trauma?  
      1. Do a little exercise and have each of the 6 Core Listed then pull up each financial strategy and have them vote on which one it matches \- can we do that meaning have them vote in Zoom \- I think so  
      2. Then list them side by side   
         1. core strategies comes in first followed by the Financial twin  
         2. Ending with all 12 linked side by side  
         3. End on the mindblowing part of it all working out \- shows that it is core truth  
   4. If we still have time we could do an exercise where we pull us each strategy explain it a little bit then have people share how it shows up in their lives.  
8. Conclusion  
   1. If we can predict it, we can solve it  
   2. What is to come  
      1. Top-level assessment for TruPath Discovery  
      2. We all blend the strategies together in our unique way but we all only have 6 colors to paint with  
      3. We have also found that people have a root strategy that defines all of their other strategies   
      4. So we will use the assessment next week to give them an insight into their subconscious patterns of survival

Call 1 \- EQ Call



4. Phase One \- FSQ \- Financial Social Quotient \- Awareness (10-15 minutes)  
   1. Identifying How a False Self-View Ties Money to Safety and Erodes Self-Worth Fear  
      1. Have a couple of people share their identities related to money, choose them from the worksheet \- the intent is to get them to say “I am…”  
      2. What does it mean to have an identity?  
      3. What does it mean to have an attachment?  
      4. Truth Cycle   
         1. Truth → Behavior → Consequence  
         2. Capital T versus Lowercase T  
      5. There are several untruths that stem from having a False Self-View (the foundations)  
         1. I am unworthy \- of financial freedom  
         2. I cannot make progress  
            1. I have to take on burdens to make up for it   
            2. stay in inaction  
         3. Isolation from the truth keeps me safe \- no clarity  
      6. I am unworthy   
         1. The need to put on a mask of False Self-View stems from the view that your true self is insufficient.

            Due to that insufficiency, we attach to identities that will limit us and keep us safe.  
      7. I cannot make progress \- or it falsifies my False Self-View  
         1. Due to my attachment to an identity I cannot make progress towards financial freedom, or I would have to let go of my mask.

            One way is to stay busy in the wrong areas.

            The other way is to stay in inaction.

            Both result in no movement towards financial freedom.  
      8. Isolation from the truth keeps me safe  
         1. This need drives me to avoid clarity, because clarity will always bring truth into our worlds and truth always defeats our lies.

            If I was to create clarity of my financial situation I would see that either I am doing better than I allow myself to believe, or that I have a clear path forward to producing a better situation.

            Either way, I would have to face my False Self-Views.  
   2. Types of attachments (15 minutes)  
      1. General  
         1. Not valuable  
         2. Not good enough

         4. They will always say no  
         5. Doubting judgment  
         6. I will fuck it up  
         7. I am naive  
         8. I have to prove myself  
         9. No confidence  
         10. It’s not fair  
      2. Post in chat \- have them put their answer in chat \- call on a couple to share what / behaviors  
      3. Financial  
         1. I cannot provide  
         2. Not good with money

         5. Careless  
         6. Constant combat

         8. Limited  
         9. Not smart  
         10. Need another one  
   4. Behaviors that limit money from those with a False self-view →   
      1. Go to the sheet and look at columns F, K → run GPT analysis to see if it works and then use those behaviors → if it doesnt work use these below  
         1. [1 False Self View Grounding Worksheet Responses WORKING - Financial TruPath](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e_Kzu1PnzlZKjN0H86jPz16DebrrrLVp79tWNUR6QkA/edit?gid=1192594934#gid=1192594934)  
      2. Come off screen share to skip slide if needed  
         1. Having resources that are not used \- my fault  
         2. Being over capacity, so there is no room for attention / chasing sparkly things \- limiting to drive self-fault  
         3. Surviving is good enough \- limiting to drive self-fault  
         4. Not showing up \- limiting to drive self-fault  
         5. Spend more than you make \- take on debt \- not paying attention (no budget) \- my fault  
         6. Doing free work \- limiting/my fault/victim  
         7. No planning \- so it can be my fault  
         8. Generally, isolate when it comes to sharing data or planning with others \- so it can be my fault  
   5. Consequences (5 minutes)  
      1. Never having enough when you need it  
         1. Not having savings  
         2. Not having enough cash on hand \- debt \- bank accounts, constant proof  
         3. Not having the things I should have

         5. Not having the house I want  
      2. Clarity  
         2. Usually trends low  
         3. At best we have the data but they tie it to not knowing what to do with it  
         4. Only look at things that validate the FSV \- checking bank accounts to ensure I have not won \- tied to the behaviors to limit it  
         5. Interestingly, generally, there is an above-average feeling of clarity which supports the idea that they only keep clarity on the things that validate the FSV  
      3. This is Important \- for them to feel dissatisfied \- We found the look that individuals who have a FSV around money \- I am not good with money \- will generally have a view that they are in a bad situation with money \- will then have to create that situation by either taking care of income or outgo but never both \- in order to create the environment of scarcity \- they will also self assess as not having fear or having fear around money but have the opposite behaviors ie act to create safety, or act to create danger  
         1. Examples  
            1. No fear \- 2 \- overspend to create scarcity, no savings  
            2. No fear \- 1 \- jump in too quickly, future tied to thing he has little influence over, feels completely stuck  
            3. No fear \- 2 \- will not pay attention to investments, jumps in quickly, trusts someone with bad performance history  
            4. Fear \- 6 \- will not pay attention to income  
         2. Generally   
            1. if I self-assess that I am scared, I will pay attention to outgo, not income  
            2. If I self-assess that I am not scared I will pay attention to income, not outgo  
      4. Clarify the Loop  
         1. I am not worthy of financial freedom, therefore I have to avoid effective action through avoidance or distraction so that I will never have enough, because…  
      5. Releasing the Loop  
         1. Why do we not change? Do the right thing? Pay attention? Take action?  
            1. Because it will work which will make us face our false self-view  
         2. What is the solution?  
            1. Letting go of our False Self-View  
5. Phase Two \- FEQ \- Financial Emotional Quotient \- Purpose

Freeing ourselves from the Identities that trap us Financially (30 minutes)

1. What is true?  
   1. Ability to grow  
      1. All humans can learn \- if not we would not have trauma  
         2. The first step to learning is awareness \- clarity  
         3. The second step is to attach to our ever-changing nature as opposed to our fixed identities based on our need for safety  
      2. Worthiness  
         1. Being Fundamentally Flawed  
            1. Can you be created in error?  
               1. Refer back to the beginning with the agreement that our consciousness is infinite  
            2. How could we ever justify the fact that we could exist other than in the unique perfection of ourselves?    
         2. Only in our traumas can we create untruths and in these untruths we create suffering.  Yet even in that suffering, we are acting in the perfect expression of ourselves as trauma is a necessity of human existence.  
         3. By having the gift of consciousness and life we have absolute proof of our worthiness which is reinforced by the fact that we have free will and can lie to ourselves about this fundamental truth.  
      3. Detaching Money from Safety  
         1. Does money truly equal safety?  
            1. Elon / Homeless example  
            2. Buried money  
         2. What is the only use of money \- coordination of action  
         3. So what is our safety eternally connected to due to the fact that we are human?  
            1. Team \- coordination of action \- love  
            2. Define Team \- two or more people coordinating action towards a shared or similar future.  
            3. Where we are in tightly coordinated action we experience success, where we are in conflict or discord we experience struggle and failure  
         4. Two Tools to Increase Coordination of Action  
            1. Purpose, Value, Connection  
            2. Honor  
         5. Tool for increasing Purpose, Value, and Connection  
            1. Asking for help

   5. External Validation Loop  
      1. Ext Val → Dependency → Lack of Control → Fear  
      2. Need to completely tie how the need for External Validation creates dependency and leads to a lack of perceived control, leading to fear  
         1. Isolation from the truth keeps me safe  
            1. I do not represent enough to be accepted alone; therefore, others’ judgment of my financial situation will determine whether I am accepted.   
            2. I must ensure that they see what I think they want to see to be accepted.  
            3. This lack of authenticity and vulnerability creates feelings of disconnection.  
      3. Releasing the Loop  
         1. Why do we not change? Do the right thing? Be authentic?  Be Vulnerable, Give and Receive help?  
            1. It will work, which will show us that money does not give us acceptance; acceptance is given through connection.  
            2. For those who misrepresent low, there may also be an underlying fear that this will drive worse performance.  
         2. What is the solution?  
            1. Taking control of our Self-Worth and thereby letting go of our need for External Validation  
   6. Phase Two \- FEQ \- Financial Emotional Quotient \- Purpose  
      1. Disconnecting our Self-Worth from our financial situation  
      2. What is true?  
      3. All humans have worth  
         1. By the nature of having life, ​​consciousness, and free will, we have already been deemed worthy by something greater than ourselves  
         2. Who are we to judge that we know better than God, the Universe, Source, etc.  
      4. Value \- the power to create change that someone desires  
         1. This is subjective  
         2. This is not something that we can control in another  
            1. Yet it is something that we can influence  
      5. Judgment \- Take back your power  
         1. What is judgment?  
            1. It is the subjective, oftentimes emotional, and usually self-reflective  
               1. You cannot judge negatively unless you dislike that quality in yourself.  
         2. Can you control the Judgment of another?  
            1. No \- everyone has the opportunity to judge us (really themselves)  
         3. What can you control?   
            1. You control whose judgments you give power to  
      6. Tool  
         1. Judgment → Power → Care  
            1. Judgment \- subjective opinion about another person  
            2. Power \- ability to influence change  
            3. Care \- history of recognizing and taking care of others’ concerns  
         2. Ineffective pattern  
            1. Giving people with no power in our lives and no history of caring for us the power to impact our state with their judgment  
         3. Effective Pattern  
            1. Giving people with power in our lives and a history of caring for us the power to influence our state with their judgment  
      7. The Power of Secrets  
         1. The degree to which you need to keep a secret is the degree to which that secret controls you.  
         2. In releasing the need to keep a secret, that secret no longer has any power over you.  
         3. We generally keep secrets (about ourselves) based on our assumptions about how others will react to that knowledge.  
         4. These secrets create distance from ourselves and from others, as well as add anxiety, fear, and worry into our relationships.  
         5. Authenticity and Vulnerability are two of the key ingredients to creating feelings of connection in others.  
         6. Sharing secrets frees us of our self-induced prison and increases the opportunity for connection with others.

   3. External Validation Loop  
      1. Ext Val → Dependency → Lack of Control → Fear  
      2. Need to completely tie how the need for External Validation creates dependency and leads to a lack of perceived control, leading to fear  
         1. Isolation from the truth keeps me safe  
            1. I do not represent enough to be accepted alone; therefore, others’ judgment of my financial situation will determine whether I am accepted.   
            2. I must ensure that they see what I think they want to see to be accepted.  
            3. This lack of authenticity and vulnerability creates feelings of disconnection.  
      3. Releasing the Loop  
         1. Why do we not change? Do the right thing? Be authentic?  Be Vulnerable, Give and Receive help?  
            1. It will work, which will show us that money does not give us acceptance; acceptance is given through connection.  
            2. For those who misrepresent low, there may also be an underlying fear that this will drive worse performance.  
         2. What is the solution?  
            1. Taking control of our Self-Worth and thereby letting go of our need for External Validation  
   4. Phase Two \- FEQ \- Financial Emotional Quotient \- Purpose  
      1. All humans have worth  
         1. By the nature of having life, ​​consciousness, and free will, we have already been deemed worthy by something greater than ourselves  
         2. Who are we to judge that we know better than God, the Universe, Source, etc.  
      2. Value \- the power to create change that someone desires  
         1. This is subjective  
         2. This is not something that we can control in another  
            1. Yet it is something that we can influence  
      3. Judgment \- Take back your power  
         1. What is judgment?  
            1. It is the subjective, oftentimes emotional, and usually self-reflective  
               1. You cannot judge negatively unless you dislike that quality in yourself.  
         2. Can you control the Judgment of another?  
            1. No \- everyone has the opportunity to judge us (really themselves)  
         3. What can you control?   
            1. You control whose judgments you give power to  
      4. Tool  
         1. Judgment → Power → Care  
            1. Judgment \- subjective opinion about another person

            3. Care \- history of recognizing and taking care of others’ concerns  
         2. Ineffective pattern  
            1. Giving people with no power in our lives and no history of caring for us the power to impact our state with their judgment  
         3. Effective Pattern  
            1. Giving people with power in our lives and a history of caring for us the power to influence our state with their judgment

         3. **Get Out of Debt**  
         4. Your top priority is aggressively paying down loans—especially high-interest balances—before you allocate heavily elsewhere.  
         5. **Feel Financially Secure**  
         6. You value a strong safety net: beefing up your emergency fund, insurance, and conservative holdings over riskier growth.  
         7. **Enjoy Life Now**  
         8. You believe in living for the moment—making room for guilt-free spending, experiences, and small indulgences today.  
         9. **Save for a Big Goal**  
         10. You have a specific target (house down-payment, education, wedding) and you’re channeling extra dollars toward that near-term milestone.

         14. You’re pouring capital into entrepreneurial pursuits—either fueling growth or shoring up cash-flow to keep operations running.  
         15. **Create Generational Wealth**  
         16. Your horizon spans decades and heirs: you favor ultra-long-term investments, estate vehicles, and legacy planning.  
         17. **Create Life Balance**  
         18. You want an even keel between today’s enjoyment, tomorrow’s stability, and future growth—no single bucket dominates.  
         19. **Reclaim Financial Control**  
         20. You’re rebounding from setbacks or chaos and need to restore order—reset budgets, shore up basics, and rebuild confidence.

Pickup Call Clarity Exercise - External Validation

1. Clarity   
   1. Findings  
      1. lowest spending by far and retirement  
      2. Highest \- Investments and Emergency Fund  
   2. Effects on stress  
      1. Income  
         1. Clarity Drives Consistent Income Management  
            1. **Behavioral Impact**: Students who feel clear about their income tend to follow through on budgeting and tracking habits more reliably.  
            2. **Action Step**: Introduce a simple daily “income log”—a one-minute habit each morning to record expected vs. actual income—to cement clarity into consistency.  
         2. What do we do about this?  
            1. Monthly \- bi monthly \- income review  
            2. If it is too low and you know it  
               1. Diagnosis  
                  1. Strategy, Behavior, Mindset  
      2. Spending and Debt  
         1. Greatest correlation to stress  
            1. **Clarity Alleviates Stress Around Spending & Debt**  
            2. Behavioral Impact: A clearer picture of where money is going and what debts remain directly reduces anxiety—more so than it increases “willpower” consistency.  
            3. Action Step: Pair each spending review with a two-minute mindful breathing or “stress check” to reinforce that clarity not only informs decisions but also soothes financial anxiety.  
         2. Stress and Performance are not connected from what we can tell, yet.  
            1. Just because you have clarity in spending and debt does not mean you will take effective action  
            2. What does move the needle?  Can we look at the difference between those with good spending scores and those with bad?  
            3. What do we do?  
               1. Need clarity \- to gain the possibility of control  
                  1. Do a simple spending study \- spreadsheet buckets \- level 1 one month, level 2 3 months is there consistency, what can we change  
                  2. Courage verses fear  
         3. Wasteful Spending Key Insights & Behavioral Takeaways:  
            1. Dining & Food (“eating out”, “fast food”, “coffee shops”)  
               1. Insight: Over half of students identify dining-related expenses as wasteful.  
               2. Action: Encourage a “home-cooked meal challenge” or “coffee-at-home experiment” to shift even one meal per week.  
            2. Subscriptions (“subscriptions”)  
               1. Insight: Recurring digital services (streaming, apps) frequently slip under the radar.  
               2. Action: Implement a monthly “subscription audit” where participants list all current subscriptions and decide which to pause or cancel.  
            3. Impulse Spending (“impulse purchases”, “amazon”, “shopping”)  
               1. Insight: Unplanned buys—often online—are a major drain.  
               2. Action: Introduce the “24-Hour Rule”: wait a full day before making non-essential purchases to curb impulse spending.  
            4. By zeroing in on these common behaviors, you can provide concrete exercises—like meal prep swaps, subscription reviews, and pause-and-plan purchase routines—to help students plug the biggest “leaks” in their budgets.   
2. Grounding Behaviors Predict Emotional Relief  
   1. **Finding**: Students who scored higher on the “Behaviors with Money” grounding worksheet (i.e. stronger, more constructive money habits) showed noticeably lower post-exercise stress levels.  
   2. **Behavioral Impact**: Concrete, day-to-day actions—like mindful spending reflections or gratitude journaling around money—translate directly into feeling calmer and more empowered after these exercises.  
   3. **Class** **Driver**: Emphasize the link between small daily rituals and immediate emotional payoff. Launch a 3-day “behavior sprint” where participants pick one grounding habit to practice and track their stress before vs. after.  
3. Scarcity Mindset Fuels Anxiety  
   1. **Finding**: Students reporting stronger scarcity beliefs (both financial and holistic) on the demographic survey consistently registered higher post-exercise stress, regardless of their clarity level.  
   2. **Behavioral Impact:** Underlying beliefs—“there’s never enough,” or “I don’t deserve abundance”—act as a silent throttle on everything from budgeting consistency to emotional resilience.  
   3. **Class Driver:** Introduce a brief scarcity-to-abundance reframing exercise. Have participants rephrase three common scarcity statements into empowering abundance affirmations, then notice the shift in stress or confidence.  
4. Low Vs High  
   1. Those with stronger objective financial situations (high “Current\_fin\_sit\_Demo”) score **significantly higher** on both their self-assessed relationship with money and their practical money behaviors.  
      1. **Relationship with Money:** Low-score students need to reframe their money narratives—shifting from avoidance or fear patterns toward recognizing money as a neutral tool.  
      2. **Practical Behaviors**: Low-score students should adopt at least two daily grounding actions (e.g., spending tracking and gratitude journaling) that mirror the higher behaviors exhibited by top-quartile peers.

   3. Phase One \- FSQ \- Financial Social Quotient \- Awareness   
      1. **Identifying how tying my suffering to the financial obligations of another creates conditional love and a net negative result.**  
         1. Suffering becomes a strategy when we don’t believe we’re allowed to simply receive.  
            1. We often feel guilt for what we’ve been given—support, love, opportunities—especially when we don’t believe we’ve earned them.

            2. That guilt doesn’t just ask for gratitude; it demands repayment through overwork, overgiving, and sacrifice.

            3. We take on too much—emotionally, financially, energetically—not because we want to give, but because we feel we must earn what was freely given.

            4. This isn’t true generosity. It’s a survival strategy—an emotional attempt to make receiving feel “safe.”

            5. When we don’t feel inherently worthy of love or ease, we begin using suffering as proof that we’ve earned our place.

            6. Suffering becomes a coping strategy for the discomfort of receiving—especially when our identity is tied to being the giver.  
            7. Narrative  
               1. We often feel guilty for what we’ve been given—support, care, opportunity—especially if we don’t believe we’ve earned it. That guilt drives a need to overcompensate, not just through gratitude, but through sacrifice. We work harder, give more, take on more than we should, just to justify receiving something that was freely given. This isn’t generosity—it’s a survival strategy.  
               2. When we don’t feel inherently worthy of love, support, or financial ease, we begin using suffering to justify what we’ve been given. This builds emotional strategies rooted in guilt, not grace. Suffering becomes a way to cope with the discomfort of receiving, especially if we don’t believe we’ve earned it.  
            8. Discussion Question  
               1. “Where in your life have you felt you had to pay for something that was meant to be a gift?”  
         2. Obligation isn’t love, it’s a signal we don’t feel worthy of love.  
            1. When we feel obligated to someone, the emotion beneath it is often **unworthiness**, not connection.

            2. We assume roles like “I must take care of them now”—financially, emotionally, or energetically—out of guilt, not choice.

            3. It feels like loyalty, but when it’s not freely chosen, it becomes a **hidden burden** that silently drives financial and relational decisions.

            4. Over time, this obligation breeds **resentment**, even as we continue to give.

            5. Culturally, obligation is often glorified as noble—but when it’s rooted in fear or guilt, it becomes a **distortion of love**, not an expression of it.  
            6. Obligation \- the choice of consequence  
            7. Narrative  
               1. When we feel obligated to someone, the emotion driving us isn’t connection—it’s unworthiness. So we frame our role as ‘I must take care of them now,’ whether financially, emotionally, or energetically. It feels like loyalty, but if it’s rooted in guilt and not choice, it becomes a hidden burden that shapes our financial behavior and keeps us stuck in resentment.  Socially, obligation is often framed as noble—but when it’s fueled by guilt or unworthiness, it becomes distortion.   
            8. Discussion Question  
               1. Do you have any financial obligations right now that feel more like a debt than a choice?  
         3. Overworking to care for others often creates the very disconnection we’re trying to avoid.  
            1. This is the loop: we overwork and overgive to prove we care or repay what we’ve received.

            2. But that very sacrifice pulls us **away from presence, connection, and joy.**

            3. We become **emotionally and energetically unavailable**, even to the people we’re trying to help.

            4. Ironically, the people we’re sacrificing for often never asked us to suffer—they just wanted *us.*

            5. Financially, this shows up as **overworking, undercharging, or taking on obligations** we can’t afford to hold.

            6. We tell ourselves it’s about love or safety, but in reality, we’re **depleting ourselves and building emotional distance.**  
            7. Narrative  
               1. This is the loop: we work ourselves to exhaustion trying to prove we care or earn back what we’ve been given. But that very sacrifice pulls us away from presence, connection, and joy. We become unavailable. We isolate. And ironically, the people we’re sacrificing for often never asked us to suffer, they just wanted us.  
               2. Financially, this shows up in overwork, undercharging, or taking on burdens beyond our means. We tell ourselves we’re creating safety or love, but in practice, we’re draining capacity, depleting presence, and building emotional distance.  
            8. Discussion Question  
               1. “Has serving those you care about through your working ever created distance instead of closeness?   
         4. Not Receiving \- When we can’t receive love without performing for it, we trap ourselves in conditional love.  
            1. At the emotional root of this loop is **conditional love**: “You can have love—but only if you keep proving you deserve it.”

            2. When we believe this, we tie **love to suffering** and make self-sacrifice a requirement for connection.

            3. The moment we stop sacrificing, we fear we’ll lose love—so we keep giving, even when we’re empty.

            4. This belief teaches us to be **suspicious of ease**—as if anything freely given must be false or temporary.

            5. It’s not love we’re practicing—it’s the logic of trauma: “If I suffer enough, I’ll be safe.”  
            6. Narrative  
               1. This is the emotional root. Conditional love says: “You can have this, but only if you keep proving you deserve it.” When we adopt this belief, we create a life where love is earned through suffering. And the moment we stop sacrificing, we fear we’ll lose connection. So we keep giving, even when we’re empty.  
               2. Conditional love is the logic trauma teaches: “If I perform well enough, suffer long enough, give hard enough—I’ll be safe and loved.” This makes us suspicious of ease.   
            7. Discussion Question  
               1. “What conditions do you unconsciously place on yourself in order to feel loved or safe in relationship?”  
         5. Sacrificing \- Love does not require sacrifice to be real, it requires presence to be felt.  
            1. True love isn’t measured by how much we lose—it’s measured by how **whole, honest, and present** we are in relationship.

            2. Financial sacrifice may feel noble, but if it **erodes your well-being or identity**, it’s not love—it’s fear wearing love’s mask.

            3. Love rooted in depletion is not generosity—it’s a **transaction built on fear of rejection or abandonment.**

            4. Real love isn’t a transaction—it’s **resonance**: mutual alignment between two whole people.

            5. When we show up emotionally clear, socially honest, and financially balanced, we allow love to **flow without depletion.**  
            6. Narrative  
               1. True love isn’t measured by how much we lose for someone else—it’s measured by how present, honest, and whole we allow ourselves to be in relationship. Financial sacrifice might feel noble, but if it erodes your well-being or identity, it’s not love—it’s a transaction rooted in fear.  
               2. True love isn’t transaction—it’s resonance. When we bring our whole selves to a relationship emotionally clear, socially honest, and financially balanced—we allow love to flow without depletion.  
            7. Discussion Question  
               1. “What would it feel like to receive love without guilt?”  
      2. Discussion Exercise \- Types of Sacrifice We Call Love (Often driven by obligation, not truth)  
         1. Definitions:  
         2. \- Suffering: Believing hardship or self-inflicted pain proves love or worth and taking on burdens to demonstrate care.    
         3. \- Sacrificing: Giving more than you can sustain—time, money, energy—to prove care or worth at the expense of your well-being.    
         4. \- Obligation/Guilt: Feeling indebted—taking on responsibilities out of guilt or pressure to repay, even at personal cost.    
         5. \- Overworking/Performative Generosity: Working harder than necessary or overgiving to earn approval, leading to imbalance or burnout.    
         6. \- Not Receiving: Feeling uncomfortable or unworthy when offered help or gifts—struggling to accept support.  
         7. Chat Prompt:  
            1. Which one do you lean on the most?  
            2. I will pull one or two to drive it down to specific actions  
         8. These behaviors aren’t wrong—but when they become strategies to earn love, they quietly disconnect us from the very people we’re trying to care for.  
      3. Unnecessary Obligations and Necessary Obligations  
         1. Necessary Obligation (Grounded, Chosen, Aligned)  
            1. Comes from clear values or agreements  
            2. Respects both your capacity and theirs  
            3. Strengthens connection without diminishing you  
            4. Often time-bound or consciously committed  
            5. You would still choose it even if you weren’t afraid to say no or afraid for what might happen to them if you said no  
            6. Examples:  
               1. Keeping a financial agreement you made to a partner  
               2. Supporting a child’s basic needs  
               3. Holding to a boundary that protects the relationship  
               4. Being present for someone’s medical crisis  
         2. Unnecessary Obligation (Unspoken, Guilt-Driven, Fear-Based)  
            1. Rooted in guilt, fear of rejection, or identity (“I’m the one who always helps”)  
            2. Depletes your energy, finances, or emotional bandwidth  
            3. Often unacknowledged or assumed  
            4. Resentment builds over time  
            5. You would not choose it if you felt worthy, loved, or safe to disappoint  
            6. Examples:  
               1. Taking on a family member’s debt to avoid shame  
               2. Staying underpaid to “be generous”

   [**Prezi**](https://prezi.com/p/edit/zxty-sliztxc/)  
   1. Intro:  
      1. Purpose of this call  
      2. 

   2. AAR: (20 minutes)  
      1. Tying my self-worth to another’s assessment of my financial situation will always lead to a dependence that we have little influence over.

         6. Living in secrecy  
   3. External Validation Loop  
      1. Ext Val → Dependency → Lack of Control → Fear  
      2. Need to completely tie how the need for External Validation creates dependency and leads to a lack of perceived control, leading to fear  
         1. Isolation from the truth keeps me safe  
            1. I do not represent enough to be accepted alone; therefore, others’ judgment of my financial situation will determine whether I am accepted.   
            2. I must ensure that they see what I think they want to see to be accepted.  
            3. This lack of authenticity and vulnerability creates feelings of disconnection.  
      3. Releasing the Loop  
         1. Why do we not change? Do the right thing? Be authentic?  Be Vulnerable, Give and Receive help?  
            1. It will work, which will show us that money does not give us acceptance; acceptance is given through connection.  
            2. For those who misrepresent low, there may also be an underlying fear that this will drive worse performance.  
         2. What is the solution?  
            1. Taking control of our Self-Worth and thereby letting go of our need for External Validation

         1. This is subjective

      3. Judgment \- Take back your power  
         1. What is judgment?  
            1. It is the subjective, oftentimes emotional, and usually self-reflective

         2. Can you control the Judgment of another?  
            1. No \- everyone has the opportunity to judge us (really themselves)

   3. Financial IQ \- Investing Tool  
      1. The purpose is to have people be clear on what types of investments they need to make \- in essence, create a buy box \- this is determined by the expected returns and if those returns are cashflow producing or Growth focused.  
      2. There are two Phases   
         1. Growth Phase \- this is the phase dedicated to growing Y \- building Wealth  
         2. Maintenance Phase \- this is the phase of stabilization using Y \- living off it  
         3. These phases can cycle  
            1. You can calculate this for building passive income, allowing for risk-free growth  
            2. So we might ask a question about if they are building this plan for short term or long term (retirement)  \- I don’t think it will change anything  
      3. Variables  
         1. X \= monthly living amount in the future (is this adjusted for inflation?)  
         2. Y \= Total capital needed to produce X a month  
         3. Z \= Expected rate of return for Future Y to Produce X a month  
         4. A \= Time until you need that monthly return  
         5. G \= rate of return needed to get to Y  
      4. There is an initial Number that is needed \- X amount a month to live on   
         1. Then there is the initial calculation that needs to be done to determine how much capital is needed Y to produce that monthly living expense at Z return   
         2. In a real app, this would be a good loop point  
      5. Deciding if you want to burn through principal will lessen the amount, but will also increase the risk  
      6. Once you know Y \= total needed and A \= time till needed, you could calculate G \= rate of return to get to Y  
         1. In this, you need to know if they want to pull any money out during the “growth Phase”  
            1. That will increase the time or the required growth rate  
      7. Tax Concerns \- will adjust investment strategies   
         1. Current \- will present different strategies and different returns  
         2. Future  
      8. The current situation must be explored to give them the right plan  
         1. Retirement  
            1. Current retirement balance \= B  
            2. Retirement Growth Rate \= C  
         2. Available Cash  
         3. Current investments  
         4. Current Income \- to calculate additional supplementation  
         5. Current Savings Amount \- to calculate future capital available \- if we are continuously adding to the pot it enables us to grow through savings and through multiplying  
      9. Potential Vehicles  
         1. Multi-family  
            1. Class A  
            2. Value Add  
            3. New Construction  
         2. Hedge Fund  
         3. Single Family Rentals \- Turn key  
         4. Short Term Rentals  
         5. Fixed Fund  
         6. Private Equity  
      10. What are the 4 dials \- 4 dial calculator   
          1. Time  
          2. Amount  
          3. Risk \- this is dependent on return needed \- this could be a scale tied to return.  
          4. Return Needed \-  dictates investment types  
          5. Tax Concern \- this would we tied to the next step  
      11. Maybe I could do an easy one that is just “Need Calculator” \- monthly amount in the future and the 4 Dial calculator that allows them to see the impact of moving a dial.  Then when they are set it give them a report with suggestions of investment types to consider and each of those could be a fixed output
