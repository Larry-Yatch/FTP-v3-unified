### Document Relationship
ðŸ“„ **This Document (Assessment Content)** â†’ WHAT to ask students  
ðŸ”§ **Implementation Guide** â†’ HOW to build and score the tools

### Key Innovation
**Belief â†’ Behavior Mapping:** Each subdomain captures a specific false belief and its associated behavioral manifestation, allowing the system to identify which beliefs are actively driving which behaviors for each individual student.

---

## ðŸ¤ Tool Overview

**Full Name:** Love & Connection Grounding Tool  
**Tool Number:** Tool 5  
**Domains:** Issues Showing Love (ISL) / Issues Receiving Love (IRL)  
**Disconnection Type:** From Others (rooted in conditional love beliefs)  
**Core Question:** "How do you use money to show and receive love, and what do you believe money says about relationships?"

### The Three Domains of Disconnection

This tool addresses **Disconnection from Others**, the second of three types of disconnection in the Financial TruPath framework:

1. **Tool 3: Disconnection from Self**
   - Pattern 1a: False Self-View (confusion and lack of clarity)
   - Pattern 1b: External Validation (misrepresentation and image management)

2. **Tool 5: Disconnection from Others** â† You are here
   - Pattern 2a: Issues Showing Love (sacrifice and refusing repayment)
   - Pattern 2b: Issues Receiving Love (dependency and obligation)

3. **Tool 7: Disconnection from All That's Greater**
   - Pattern 3a: Control Leading to Isolation (self-imposed suffering)
   - Pattern 3b: Fear Leading to Isolation (ensuring things go wrong)

---

## ðŸ§  Core Concept & Philosophy

### The Grounding Metaphor
This tool "grounds" students' understanding by:
- **Revealing WHAT** they're doing that's ineffective (behaviors)
- **Explaining WHY** they're doing it (beliefs)
- **Measuring HOW MUCH** it impacts them (scores)
- **Identifying WHERE to focus** (highest scoring subdomains)

### Disconnection from Others
When students are disconnected from others, they experience:
- **Compulsive giving without boundaries** - Unable to say no or accept repayment
- **Refusing to receive help** - Believing accepting help is weakness or creates debt
- **Financial dependency on others** - Unable to stand independently financially
- **Relationship manipulation through money** - Using guilt or obligation around financial help

## ðŸŽ¯ Assessment Design Principles

### 1. Belief â†’ Behavior Separation
Each subdomain measures a specific belief AND its associated behavior as separate scores. This reveals whether:
- **Belief is driving behavior** (both high) - the belief is active and manifesting
- **Behavior exists without this belief** (behavior high, belief low) - check other subdomains for the driving belief
- **Belief exists without manifesting in this behavior** (belief high, behavior low) - manifesting through different subdomain behaviors

### 2. Clean Measurement
Behavior questions measure ONLY the behavior, without conditional phrasing like "when I feel X, I do Y." This ensures we get accurate behavioral data regardless of belief strength. Students rate behaviors as they actually occur, not theories about what drives them.

### 3. Student-Friendly Language
All subdomain names and questions use accessible language students can understand and relate to, not clinical jargon. We say "I Must Give to Be Loved" instead of "Compulsive Caretaking Pattern." Questions use everyday language about real experiences.

### 4. Compassionate Framing
Questions are framed to create self-awareness, not shame. Students are discovering patterns, not being diagnosed with disorders. Language emphasizes "noticing," "learning," and "working through" rather than failure or pathology.

### 5. Actionable Subdomains
Each subdomain is specific enough that guidance can be targeted: "Your 'I Can't Accept Help' pattern means..." not just "You have Issues Showing Love." Specificity enables actionable next steps.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure
Students complete one subdomain at a time (one page per subdomain), preventing overwhelm. They don't see all 36 questions at once. This creates focus and reduces assessment fatigue.

### 7. Open Response Integration
Two open-ended questions per subdomain provide qualitative data that enriches analysis and makes insights specific to the individual. These questions probe the "why" behind the scores.

### 8. Scoring Transparency
Students see their scores at multiple levels (subdomain, domain, overall) with clear explanations of what each means. Transparency builds trust and understanding.

### 9. Gap Analysis Clarity
The gap between highest subdomain and domain average tells students WHERE to focus, not just that a pattern exists. This creates actionable starting points.

### 10. Non-Diagnostic Language
Throughout, we use language like "pattern," "strategy," "approach" rather than "disorder," "dysfunction," "pathology." This maintains a growth-oriented, compassionate frame.

## Domain 1: Issues Showing Love (ISL)

**Core Pattern:** Sacrifice and refusing repayment as primary mechanism  
**Signature:** Money flows out without boundaries; inability to say no or accept repayment  
**Effect:** Self-impoverishment through compulsive generosity and refusing to receive

---

### Subdomain 1.1: "I Must Give to Be Loved"
**Belief â†’ Behavior Connection:** Believing love requires sacrifice leads to compulsive giving

**Belief Scale (-3 to +3):**

## ðŸ“ Notes & Considerations

### Scoring Philosophy
We use **-3 to +3 scales without zero** because:
- **No neutral escape** - students must take a position one way or the other
- **Negative numbers indicate pattern IS present** - problematic/unhealthy end of spectrum
- **Positive numbers indicate pattern is NOT present** - healthy/functional end of spectrum
- **Forces engagement** - students can't hide in "neutral" and must honestly assess where they fall
- **More intuitive direction** - negative feels "bad" and positive feels "good" to most people

### Subdomain Count
**Three subdomains per domain** provides:
- **Enough granularity to be specific** - students get targeted insights, not vague generalities
- **Not so many that students get overwhelmed** - 6 total subdomains per tool is manageable
- **Clean gap analysis** - 3 is small enough to easily identify which subdomain is highest
- **Manageable GPT processing** - 6 calls per tool (one per subdomain) is efficient

### Open Response Strategy
**Two questions per subdomain** because:
- **One question might not capture the nuance** - people need multiple angles to explore
- **Two allows exploration and confirmation** - first question opens, second deepens
- **More than two risks overwhelming students** - assessment fatigue is real
- **Provides rich qualitative data for GPT** - enough context without overwhelming

### Gap Thresholds
The gap classification helps students understand where to focus:

- **< 5 points = DIFFUSE** (all subdomains similar, work on domain as whole)
  - No single subdomain stands out significantly
  - Address the overall domain pattern
  
- **5-15 points = FOCUSED** (one subdomain elevated, start there)
  - One subdomain is moderately higher than average
  - Start with highest but recognize others contribute
  
- **> 15 points = HIGHLY FOCUSED** (one subdomain dominant, clear starting point)
  - One subdomain is dramatically higher
  - Very clear where to begin work

**These thresholds are based on:**
- **Practical significance** - 5 points = noticeable difference students can feel
- **Statistical variation** - avoiding over-interpretation of small, random gaps
- **Actionability** - students need clear guidance, not ambiguity about next steps
