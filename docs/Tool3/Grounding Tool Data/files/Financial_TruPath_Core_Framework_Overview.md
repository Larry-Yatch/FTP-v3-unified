# Financial TruPath: Core Framework Overview

## The Three Domains of Disconnection

Financial trauma manifests through **three core strategies of disconnection for safety**. Each domain represents a fundamental way we separate ourselves from what we need to thrive:

1. **Disconnection from Self** (rooted in low self-worth)
2. **Disconnection from Others** (rooted in conditional love)  
3. **Disconnection from All That's Greater Than Us** (rooted in attachment to a made-up future)

Within each domain, there are **two strategies: one active and one passive.**

---

## Understanding the Structure

### The Active/Passive Pattern

**Active patterns:** The person does, creates, or takes action to maintain the strategy.  
**Passive patterns:** The person allows, withdraws, or lets things happen to maintain the strategy.

This creates six distinct subdomains:

| Domain | Active Strategy | Passive Strategy |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Disconnection from Self** | False Self-View<br>(I actively create scarcity and confusion to prove my inadequacy) | External Validation<br>(I passively allow others' judgment to determine my worth through curating their perception) |
| **Disconnection from Others** | Issues Showing Love<br>(I actively take on others' burdens and refuse repayment to prove love through suffering) | Issues Receiving Love<br>(I passively become dependent on others, creating obligation that prevents experiencing love) |
| **Disconnection from All That's Greater** | Control Leading to Isolation<br>(I actively control into suffering by not charging worth, not collecting, and giving away free) | Fear Leading to Isolation<br>(I passively ensure things go wrong by trusting wrongly and not protecting myself) |

## The "Money Is..." Paradox

Each subdomain operates through a core untruth about what money represents. This creates a **paradoxical prison**: by attaching our goal to money, we guarantee we can never achieve it.

### 1. Disconnection from Self (Low Self-Worth)

#### 1a. False Self-View (ACTIVE)
**"Money is Safety"**
- **Goal:** I will gain safety through money
- **Prison:** By connecting safety to money, I will never truly be safe
- **Primary Behavior:** Self-created scarcity through confusion and lack of clarity (ignoring income if I feel scarce, ignoring spending if I feel abundant)
- **The Trap:** I create confusion and scarcity to prove my inadequacy, which maintains the false self-view that keeps me "safe" from my potential
- **Pattern Reinforcement:** Never having money when needed despite earning, scattered resources I can't access, manufactured financial close calls

#### 1b. External Validation (PASSIVE)  
**"Money is Acceptance"**
- **Goal:** We gain acceptance through money
- **Prison:** By connecting acceptance to money and others' judgment of my money, I can never truly be accepted
- **Primary Behavior:** Misrepresenting my financial situation (appearing to have more OR less than I actually have)
- **The Trap:** I must constantly manage the image, creating performance-based existence where vulnerability equals rejection
- **Pattern Reinforcement:** Exhaustion from maintaining facade, debt from image spending, no authentic relationships

---

### 2. Disconnection from Others (Conditional Love)

#### 2a. Issues Showing Love (ACTIVE)
**"Money is Sacrifice"**
- **Goal:** If I have enough money, it will free us from having to sacrifice
- **Prison:** By connecting sacrifice to love, I will always sacrifice, ensuring I never have enough money
- **Primary Behavior:** Taking on others' financial obligations, even when not asked; suffering/sacrificing for others
- **The Trap:** I DON'T want repayment because receiving would lessen my suffering, and suffering is how I prove love
- **Conditionality Created:** "My suffering proves my love" (but real love doesn't require suffering)

#### 2b. Issues Receiving Love (PASSIVE)
**"Money is Evil"**  
- **Goal:** I need others to provide my financial safety because I can't/shouldn't do it myself
- **Prison:** By making my safety dependent on others' resources, I create obligation that prevents experiencing unconditional love
- **Primary Behavior:** Becoming financially dependent/reliant on others; racking up debt; relying on others for financial decisions
- **The Trap:** Dependency creates obligation; "you gave to me, I owe you"
- **Conditionality Created:** The debt/obligation prevents experiencing love, because love can only be experienced without conditions
- **Underlying Belief:** Money itself may be seen as corrupting, so staying dependent keeps one "good" while still having resources

---

### 3. Disconnection from All That's Greater (Attachment to Made-Up Future)

#### 3a. Control Leading to Isolation (ACTIVE)
**"Money is Control"**
- **Goal:** We will gain control through money  
- **Prison:** By making control dependent on money, even if I have moneyâ€”since the money is not meâ€”I can never have control
- **Primary Behavior:** Self-imposed suffering; going without (not charging what I'm worth, accounts receivable piling up, giving things away for free)
- **The Trap:** I control my world into ensuring I live without, which substantiates the fear that drives my need for control
- **Pattern Reinforcement:** Underearning from artificially low prices, uncollected money owed, living in lack despite having resources

#### 3b. Fear Leading to Isolation (PASSIVE)
**"Money is Fear"**
- **Goal:** It is through money that we will free ourselves from fear
- **Prison:** By making that attachment, the more money we have, the more we fear its loss. We can't win if we don't have money, or if we do
- **Primary Behavior:** Ensuring things go wrong (trusting people we shouldn't, not protecting ourselves in deals, no contracts)
- **The Trap:** I unconsciously create the disasters I'm trying to avoid, proving the world is unsafe
- **Pattern Reinforcement:** Repeated financial disasters from ignored red flags, losses from lack of protection, self-sabotage at threshold of success

## Behavioral Signatures: Quick Reference

When observing financial behavior, here's what distinguishes each subdomain:

| Subdomain | Telltale Behavior | What It Looks Like |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **False Self-View** | Self-created scarcity through confusion and lack of clarity | Ignoring income when feeling scarce OR ignoring spending when feeling abundant; never having money when you need it despite earning |
| **External Validation** | Misrepresenting financial situation | Buying status symbols OR hiding wealth; appearing richer OR poorer than reality; everything about image management |
| **Showing Love** | Taking on others' obligations (unasked) | Paying for adult children, bailing out friends, sacrificing your needs for others; refusing repayment |
| **Receiving Love** | Becoming financially dependent/reliant | Letting others pay, racking up debt to others, needing financial management from others; feeling obligated |
| **Control** | Self-imposed suffering/going without | Not charging worth, unpaid invoices piling up, giving away free work; hoarding while living in lack |
| **Fear** | Ensuring things go wrong | Trusting the wrong people (when you knew better), no contracts, no protection; unconscious self-sabotage |

---

## The Core Roots of Each Domain

Understanding what drives each domain helps identify which patterns are active:

### Domain 1: Disconnection from Self
**Root: Low Self-Worth**

When we don't believe we are inherently worthy, we create false narratives about ourselves (FSV) or give others the power to determine our worth (ExVal). Both keep us disconnected from our true value.

### Domain 2: Disconnection from Others  
**Root: Conditional Love**

When we believe love must be earned or comes with strings, we either sacrifice to prove love (Showing Love) or create obligation that prevents experiencing love (Receiving Love). Both ensure we never experience unconditional love.

### Domain 3: Disconnection from All That's Greater
**Root: Attachment to Made-Up Future**

When we can't trust in something greater than ourselves, we either grip tightly trying to control outcomes (Control) or hide to avoid imagined disasters (Fear). Both create the isolation and scarcity we're trying to prevent.

## How the Strategies Interconnect

While each subdomain is distinct, people rarely suffer from just one. Common combinations:

- **FSV + Control:** "I'm not good enough AND I must control everything to compensate"
- **ExVal + Showing Love:** "I must look successful AND sacrifice to prove I care"  
- **Receiving Love + Fear:** "I become dependent AND hide from visibility"
- **FSV + Fear:** "I'm inadequate AND I must stay small to be safe"

Understanding your primary pattern(s) helps target the specific untruth driving your financial trauma.

---

## The Path to Truth

Each subdomain has an opposite truth that breaks the paradox:

| Subdomain | The Untruth | The Truth Path |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **False Self-View** | Money is safety | Safety comes from self-trust and coordination of action; money is a neutral tool |
| **External Validation** | Money is acceptance | Acceptance comes from authentic connection; your worth is inherent, not determined by others |
| **Showing Love** | Money is sacrifice | Love is expressed through empowerment, not depletion; boundaries are acts of love |
| **Receiving Love** | Money is evil | Money is neutral; receiving without obligation allows genuine love and interdependence |
| **Control** | Money is control | True security comes from trust and surrender; control is an exhausting illusion |
| **Fear** | Money is fear | Abundance comes from stepping into visibility; you are held by something greater |

## Using This Framework

### For Assessment:
1. Identify which domain(s) resonate most (self, others, or greater)
2. Determine if your pattern is active (doing/creating) or passive (allowing/avoiding)  
3. Look for the behavioral signature to confirm

### For Healing:
1. Name the core untruth operating in your life
2. Recognize the "Money is..." paradox keeping you trapped
3. Challenge the root (low self-worth, conditional love, or attachment to made-up future)
4. Practice the opposite truth path
5. Shift behaviors from the signature pattern to aligned actions

### For Teaching:
- Start with the three domains (most people identify with one primary domain)
- Introduce the active/passive distinction (helps pinpoint specific subdomain)
- Reveal the "Money is..." paradox (this creates the "aha" moment)
- Show the behavioral signature (makes it concrete and recognizable)
- Offer the truth path (provides hope and direction)

## Next Steps

This framework provides the map. The detailed subdomain sections provide:
- Untruth Strategy Matrix (belief â†’ behaviors â†’ feelings â†’ consequences)
- Deep pattern understanding
- Truth tools and reframes  
- Financial exercises for practice

Each person's journey is unique, but the patterns are universal. By identifying your specific strategy of disconnection, you can begin reconnecting to self, others, and all that is greaterâ€”finding true financial freedom.
