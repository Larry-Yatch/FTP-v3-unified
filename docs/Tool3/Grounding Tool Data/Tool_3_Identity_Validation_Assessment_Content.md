## 🪞 Tool Overview

**Full Name:** Identity & Validation Grounding Tool  
**Tool Number:** Tool 3  
**Domains:** False Self-View (FSV) / External Validation (ExVal)  
**Disconnection Type:** From Self (rooted in low self-worth)  
**Core Question:** "How do you see yourself, and how do others' opinions influence you?"

### The Three Domains of Disconnection

This tool addresses **Disconnection from Self**, the first of three types of disconnection in the Financial TruPath framework:

1. **Tool 3: Disconnection from Self** ← You are here
   - Pattern 1a: False Self-View (confusion and lack of clarity)
   - Pattern 1b: External Validation (misrepresentation and image management)

2. **Tool 5: Disconnection from Others**
   - Pattern 2a: Issues Showing Love (sacrifice and refusing repayment)
   - Pattern 2b: Issues Receiving Love (dependency and obligation)

3. **Tool 7: Disconnection from All That's Greater**
   - Pattern 3a: Control Leading to Isolation (self-imposed suffering)
   - Pattern 3b: Fear Leading to Isolation (ensuring things go wrong)

---

## 🧠 Core Concept & Philosophy

### The Grounding Metaphor
This tool "grounds" students' understanding by:
- **Revealing WHAT** they're doing that's ineffective (behaviors)
- **Explaining WHY** they're doing it (beliefs)
- **Measuring HOW MUCH** it impacts them (scores)
- **Identifying WHERE to focus** (highest scoring subdomains)

### Disconnection from Self
When students are disconnected from themselves, they experience:
- **Confusion about their financial reality** - Can't see clearly what they have or need
- **Constant external comparison** - Measuring worth by others' standards and opinions
- **Financial decisions driven by image** - Spending to project success rather than meet real needs
- **Shame and hiding** - Feeling unworthy and concealing financial truth

## 🎯 Assessment Design Principles

### 1. Belief → Behavior Separation
Each subdomain measures a specific belief AND its associated behavior as separate scores. This reveals whether:
- **Belief is driving behavior** (both high) - the belief is active and manifesting
- **Behavior exists without this belief** (behavior high, belief low) - check other subdomains for the driving belief
- **Belief exists without manifesting in this behavior** (belief high, behavior low) - manifesting through different subdomain behaviors

### 2. Clean Measurement
Behavior questions measure ONLY the behavior, without conditional phrasing like "when I feel X, I do Y." This ensures we get accurate behavioral data regardless of belief strength. Students rate behaviors as they actually occur, not theories about what drives them.

### 3. Student-Friendly Language
All subdomain names and questions use accessible language students can understand and relate to, not clinical jargon. We say "I'm Not Worthy" instead of "Unworthiness-Based Avoidance Pattern." Questions use everyday language about real experiences.

### 4. Compassionate Framing
Questions are framed to create self-awareness, not shame. Students are discovering patterns, not being diagnosed with disorders. Language emphasizes "noticing," "learning," and "working through" rather than failure or pathology.

### 5. Actionable Subdomains
Each subdomain is specific enough that guidance can be targeted: "Your 'Income Ignoring' pattern means..." not just "You have False Self-View." Specificity enables actionable next steps.

### 6. Progressive Disclosure
Students complete one subdomain at a time (one page per subdomain), preventing overwhelm. They don't see all 30 questions at once. This creates focus and reduces assessment fatigue.

### 7. Open Response Integration
One open-ended question per subdomain provides qualitative data that enriches analysis and makes insights specific to the individual. These questions probe the "why" behind the scores.

### 8. Scoring Transparency
Students see their scores at multiple levels (subdomain, domain, overall) with clear explanations of what each means. Transparency builds trust and understanding.

### 9. Gap Analysis Clarity
The gap between highest subdomain and domain average tells students WHERE to focus, not just that a pattern exists. This creates actionable starting points.

### 10. Non-Diagnostic Language
Throughout, we use language like "pattern," "strategy," "approach" rather than "disorder," "dysfunction," "pathology." This maintains a growth-oriented, compassionate frame.

## Domain 1: False Self-View (FSV)

**Core Pattern:** Confusion and lack of clarity as primary mechanism  
**Signature:** Money exists but can't access when needed; selective blindness  
**Effect:** Self-created scarcity through inability to see financial reality clearly

---

### Subdomain 1.1: "I'm Not Worthy of Financial Freedom"
**Belief → Behavior Connection:** Unworthiness leads to avoidance and scattering

**Belief Scale (-3 to +3):**
> "I'm not the kind of person who gets to have financial freedom"

- **-3** = Strongly agree - I'm absolutely certain financial freedom is not for someone like me; people like me don't get that
- **-2** = Agree - I believe financial freedom is for other kinds of people, not someone like me
- **-1** = Slightly agree - I often feel like I'm not the type who gets financial freedom, though I'm questioning this
- **+1** = Slightly disagree - I'm learning I can be the kind of person who has financial freedom, though doubts linger
- **+2** = Disagree - I generally believe I can be someone who has financial freedom, though I occasionally question it

"What specifically are you afraid you'd find or have to face if you looked at your finances clearly right now?"

---

### Subdomain 1.2: "I'll Never Have Enough"

- **+3** = Never - I consistently make calm, informed decisions and recognize available opportunities

**Open Response Question:**

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Scoring Philosophy
We use **-3 to +3 scales without zero** because:
- **No neutral escape** - students must take a position one way or the other
- **Negative numbers indicate pattern IS present** - problematic/unhealthy end of spectrum
- **Positive numbers indicate pattern is NOT present** - healthy/functional end of spectrum
- **Forces engagement** - students can't hide in "neutral" and must honestly assess where they fall
- **More intuitive direction** - negative feels "bad" and positive feels "good" to most people

### Subdomain Count
**Three subdomains per domain** provides:
- **Enough granularity to be specific** - students get targeted insights, not vague generalities
- **Not so many that students get overwhelmed** - 6 total subdomains per tool is manageable
- **Clean gap analysis** - 3 is small enough to easily identify which subdomain is highest
- **Manageable GPT processing** - 6 calls per tool (one per subdomain) is efficient

### Open Response Strategy
**One question per subdomain** because:
- **Focused exploration** - one well-crafted question targets the core of each subdomain
- **Reduces assessment fatigue** - 6 total open responses (vs 12) keeps engagement high
- **Sufficient for GPT analysis** - one thoughtful response provides rich qualitative data
- **Respects student time** - maintains assessment completion rate

### Gap Thresholds
The gap classification helps students understand where to focus:

- **< 5 points = DIFFUSE** (all subdomains similar, work on domain as whole)
  - No single subdomain stands out significantly
  - Address the overall domain pattern
  
- **5-15 points = FOCUSED** (one subdomain elevated, start there)
  - One subdomain is moderately higher than average
  - Start with highest but recognize others contribute
  
- **> 15 points = HIGHLY FOCUSED** (one subdomain dominant, clear starting point)
  - One subdomain is dramatically higher
  - Very clear where to begin work

**These thresholds are based on:**
- **Practical significance** - 5 points = noticeable difference students can feel
- **Statistical variation** - avoiding over-interpretation of small, random gaps
- **Actionability** - students need clear guidance, not ambiguity about next steps
